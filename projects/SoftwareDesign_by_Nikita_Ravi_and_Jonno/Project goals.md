## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
* We want to make an intuitive program that can be used by people without any experience
* We want to be able to visualise data in said program
* we want to be able to adjust sensors in said program if needed
### Subgoals
* Make the model part
* Make the controller part
* Make the view part
* Transfer the sensor-signal to data
* Make an artificial data stream to test the model and interface

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
