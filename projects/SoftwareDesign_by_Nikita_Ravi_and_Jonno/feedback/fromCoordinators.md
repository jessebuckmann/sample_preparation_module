# Week 4 discussion

Team Nikita, Ravi, Jonno

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ Readme needs some expansion
+ how do you test your achivements? what defines the requirements?
+ why raspberry pi and not digilent? -> already settled on digilent
+ how are the roles defined in the group?

### Conversation on the progress status

+ document you communication with the other groups as much as possible, and make these communications referenceable

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
nice compilation, clearly considerate of the reader and a very good landing page.
I only have a minor suggestion: perhaps also suggest how people can follow up on the existing issues, how to report bugs, and how to share their experiences after going through your guidelines. e.g. have a template issue. 

### on Instructions (timestamp: 12/10/2020 ~15h)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Instructions are very clear to find. The installation guide is presented step-by-step. Good job! I don't think I have much to add :)
