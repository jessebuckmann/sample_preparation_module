# Aloha!

You find yourself at the front page of the Software Design group 2020 consisting of Jonno, Nikita, and Ravi. This is the folder for the Software Design group documentation and programs.

Welcome! üéä üòç üòÑ :kissing_heart:



#### Short description

Our plans are to write one simple rule-them-all program, which consists of different components which interact with each other. The inspiration of our program is the [labphew](https://labphew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. The plan for now is to follow short-period development lifecycle when during one iteration we realize a small number of features and changes, then ask all the other groups how this corresponds to their needs, collect feedback, adjust the specifications, and start the next iteration. The contents of this directory may drastically change as we continue to specify the requirements from the other teams. [How to reach us](#How to reach us).

#### Long description

The files in this directory contain most of the information about what the software team is doing. To start, you can check the [Programs](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Programs) folder which contains all the code we wrote so far.

[Installation guide](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Installation_guide.md) contains all necessary instructions how to install everything and the [README](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Programs/README.md) in the Programs folder gets you up and running. 

The files in the main directory will be updated as we progress in our work and the important messages will be listed [in updates](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/UPDATES.md).

The [program specifications](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/ProgramSpecifications.md) file is the table of components of our program with detailed requirements for each of them. If you want to see more functionality of any component, contact us.

If people working on other parts of the project want to see what do we need from them, it is written in the [Canvas file:resources required section](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Canvas.md#resources-required) as well as the other problems we want to tackle. Also in the Programs forder there is a [CONTRIBUTING](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Programs/CONTRIBUTING.md) file on how to contribute.

Btw, if someone is interested what exactly we are doing and what our plans are, [Project goals](projects/SoftwareDesign_by_Nikita_Ravi_and_Jonno/Project_goals.md) file is your first place to go.
