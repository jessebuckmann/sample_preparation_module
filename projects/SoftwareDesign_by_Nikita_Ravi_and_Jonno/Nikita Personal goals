## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)

*Fill here what you expect to learn in this course personally and define your personal goals*

Personal goals:

* Try to follow the useful(may be found on the internet or elsewhere) methodologies for intercommunication in a team and between teams. Despite that we as a students are guarded a little bit from the complexity of real world, I suppose it would be useful to work out the framework(s) to communicate efficiently. People have already invented something worthwhile, for sure. Build the efficient information exchange system. How, in what format, when and where the data between members should be send, posted, etc.
* The same can be said about the correctly spiting the grand project into group projects, each one as independent as possible from the others. The goal here is to figure out the patterns or inner logic of that process, regardless of the area of grand project.
* Improve programming skills in Python.
* Participate in a group programming project, try to do everything as professional from the programmer point of view as possible.
* Study and think out the course syllabus materials.

The realization of my personal goals is what I expect to learn in that course. 

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)

I would say that for now I'm not ready to really say something worthwhile on the topic. Mostly because until now all the groups were building their subprojects rather separately from each other, and we are not under the pressure of harsh deadlines. And we can asses how correctly we spitted the tasks closer to the moment when we will assemble the box. My group for the project is great in all ways, just people nice to work with. For now that's it.

## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)

*Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
