Few points to take away from a conversation with Dante:

+ Monitoring the power usage and communication with other devices is more important than we anticipated.
+ Solar panel may be too complicated and take too long to obtain a useful one.
+ components for load switch can be found in the workshop.
+ Semi DIY option is the most reasonable option to build.
