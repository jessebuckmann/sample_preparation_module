# solar panel test results
The results from a small test done on small solar panels provided. 
Its purpose is to get an indication of the range of output voltages depending on the luminosity.
A luminosity of 650 W/m^2 was chieved during an afternoon sunny and 15 W/m^2 on the same day in full shade.
The latter can be used as a minimum luminosity to get anything useful out of the panel.
