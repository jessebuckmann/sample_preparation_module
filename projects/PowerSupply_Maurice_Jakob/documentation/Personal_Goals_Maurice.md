## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*Fill here what you expect to learn in this course personally and define your personal goals*

Regarding theory:
+ [ ] Understand each component on a basic level required to have a complete scientific station.
+ [ ] Have the knowledge and skills the build a solar power station from scratch.

Regarding group projects:
+ [ ] Learn about the dynamics and interactions of group management  of a 'grand' project.
+ [ ] Participate on a satifactory level within the group.


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.*

During the first 2 weeks, we had to spend so much time on diving into the workings of electronics that I can surely say I understand all the components of a power supply on a sufficient level to build one myself.
Whether I also have the skills will show in the next week.

It took us too long to understand the electronics well enough to share what we can or can not provide, that we did not have good coommunication witht he other sub-groups at the start of the project.
However, this is currently a lot better.

I learned quite a bit of the process of group projects and how I should participate in them. Personal thing to take note off: talk earlier, even if you have no clue what you are talking about yet.

Overall this project feels to short to have an iterative and more interactive environement. Everyone is focused on finishing their own part within the time limit, where there could be more coorporation.

### list of contacts and state of value exchanges

Dante Killian: This exchange feels very one-sided. We need to learn about electronics and practical skills to build such systems. Dante provides this knowledge, with nothing in return.

Gerhard Blab: He is a mentor for this project, where general initial guidance was provided. Key values are: Pay-it-forward, in order to educate us to the level of potential master-thesis project and/or PhD students.

Sanli Faez: General guidance of the process of participating in a group project. key values: Altriusm, pay-it-forward. To establish a better scientific world based on open-source projects.

Other subgroups within the project: key values: feedback, professional development, to learn about group projects and understand the purpose of being concious about group interactions.

In an ideal state I would have the feeling i'm providing something for the supervisors as well. However, I think that is the nature of the educational system.

## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
