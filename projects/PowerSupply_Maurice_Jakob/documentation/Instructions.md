## safety recommendations


## assembly + test measurements

### Step 1: Connect Charge controller
1. Put the Charge controller (CC) in an upright position (see picture)
[picture]
2. Connect the battery to the CC by first connecting the red cable to the positive pole of the CC, then the black to the negative.
3. In the same order, connect the solar panel to the CC.
Use the solar cable with MC4 connectors attached to one side.
Those determine where to attach it at the panel.

**Measurement**
Measure the voltage at the battery using a multimeter over at least 10 minutes.
Check if it is increasing in the range 12.7-13.8 V.
Compare that with the charging curve in the [datasheet](https://asset.conrad.com/media10/add/160267/c1/-/en/000250916DS01/datablad-250916-conrad-energy-12-v-12-ah-loodaccu-12-v-12-ah-loodvlies-agm-b-x-h-x-d-151-x-95-x-98-mm-kabelschoen-635-mm-onderhouds.pdf)
