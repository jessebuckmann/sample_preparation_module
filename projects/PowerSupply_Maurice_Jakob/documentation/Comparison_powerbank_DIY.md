# Comparison of a system based around power bank or fully DIY solar panel power station

## Power bank

### Advantages

+ Simple system, with internal charge controller
+ more advanced powerbanks even have option for 220V AC output
+ 5V USB output used for the common Arduino

### disavantage

+ less control over output voltages. (Unless load has USB-C commmunication option to increase voltage up to 20V)
+ Not able to use solar panel as power source directly for the load, which results in low overal power consumtion ceiling
+ Can be slow to charge, due to power input limit

## DIY solar panel power station

### Advantages
+ Extremely versatile
+ Has option to use 12V battery, which usually have higher power output ceiling
+ Use solar cell and battery as power source in parallel

### disavantage
+ Requires 50+ parts 
+ Requires a lot of testing
+ Very fragile without expert knowledge on electronics
