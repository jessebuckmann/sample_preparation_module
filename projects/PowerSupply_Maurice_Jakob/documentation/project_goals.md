# Project goals

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball 
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

PROJECT NAME: Power supply
PROJECT MEMBERS: Maurice Jongerhuis, Jakob Schr√∂der

## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)

- Stable power supply 
- Quantitative goal: 200W for 6h 
- Flexible connection for all consumers 


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note your progress and re-adjust your goals such that you can deliver at the end*

A [setup](./images/circuit.png) was designed, with [these](./list_of_components.md) parts, that has enough features and is still obtainable within our timeframe.

- Stability is provided by internal electronics of the powerbank and the charge controller
- 200W for 6h would require a massive lead-acid battery that would be too heavy for the science station. 
The current setup can provide 150W AC and 2400W DC at peak consumption. 
We expect to use about 50W in total during normal operation. Which results in 3 hours operation time without charging suring operation.
If more is needed, additional batteries can easily be added in parallel.
- Regarding connection, we have many USB ports for the arduinos that are being used. 
Additionally at regular 230V AC wall socket for special devices.
The 12V DC can be used or divided/converted to any desired voltages. However, this is currently not planned.  


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
