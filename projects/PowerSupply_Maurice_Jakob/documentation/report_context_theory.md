### Goal of the project

*what we try to accomplish, this leads to the chosen project outline*

The goal of the power supply project is to construct a circuit that supplies stable power to all electronic devices (loads) of the science station in an off-grid fashion.
For that we chose power generation by solar panels, which makes us independet of wall outlets.
As the power coming from the panels is dependent on lighting, we need to interconnect a power storage that can supply stable power when charged up.
The loads of the science station can in principle run on DC or AC current and at different voltages. This affects the choice of batteries and additional components we need as described below.


### Project outline

### Important considerations

*all the stuff about conversion and all the connections*

- charge controller for battery
- voltage monitoring
- inverter

### Possible sources of noise

*which parts are sensitive to noise, which parts produce noise (noise = e.g. voltage fluctuations)*
