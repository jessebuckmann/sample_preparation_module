# Power supply for Experiment box

In this subproject considerations and the design of a power supply that suffices for the needs required are made.
The goals of this project are briefly elaborated on the [canvas](./documentation/project_canvas_ps.pptx).

A comparison between different levels of DIY can be found [here](./documentation/Comparison_powerbank_DIY.md).
Where the major difference is the level of knowledge regarding electronics required to build it.


A current list of parts for this project can be found [here](./documentation/list_of_components.md).
The current plan consist of a powerbank (5V), 12V lead acid and inverter to provide all the needs specified.
A load-switch and monitoring system will provide the safety and communication with other parts of the box.
It is further expanded with a solar panel to charge the station remotely.
