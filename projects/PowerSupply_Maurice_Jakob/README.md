# Power supply for Experiment box

In this subproject considerations and the design of a power supply that suffices for the needs required are made.
The goals of this project are briefly presented in the [canvas](./documentation/project_canvas_ps.pptx) and further elaborated in this [report](./documentation/report_context_theory.md).

To settle on the right approach a comparison between different levels of DIY was made which can be found [here](./documentation/Comparison_powerbank_DIY.md).
The major difference is the level of knowledge regarding electronics required to build it.

A current list of parts for this project can be found [here](./documentation/list_of_components.md).
The current plan consist of a powerbank (5V), 12V lead acid and inverter to provide all the needs specified.
A load-switch and monitoring system will provide the safety and communication with other parts of the box.
It is further expanded with a solar panel to charge the station remotely.

How to put everything together is documented in the [instructions](./documentation/Instructions.md). 
There is also a separate [documentation](-/documentation/Arduino/Arduino_Instructions.md) about monitoring the battery voltage.
