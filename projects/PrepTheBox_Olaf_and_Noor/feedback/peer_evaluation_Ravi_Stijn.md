## Report 

### Documentation:

**1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.**  
    It's not really explained why this experiment shows that the design of the box leads to a properly functional box. We did understand that you had to ask other groups what they wanted to show that it had all of these features.

**2.	Were the safety instructions clear?**  
    Yes, but it is still very hard to open the box. The front panel is missing some form of handle. It also says your laptop is in the box during the experiment, but this is not true.  

**3.	How helpful is the documentation for reproducing the measurement?**  
    Reproducing is quite easy with the documentation, but be a little more specific on where exactly you want to put the sensor/beakers. Unclear how to raise the right panel. We made a guess.

**4.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?**  
    Not really clear what you need the USBlogger for in the beginning but we figured it out. 

**5.	Are you guided to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?**  
    The README does guide you to the previous measurements.

**6.	What can be improved in the documentation?**  
    Be more clear on the exact setup of the experiment such as placement of the sensor/beakers. Also, add a list of what people want for the box, because this is not reproducible if we do not know what they told you.

### Measurements:

**1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions?**  
    Be a little more specific on where exactly you want to put the sensor/beakers. 

**2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?**    
    Our result for the closed box was not what was previously reported. Our graph can be found [here](projects/PrepTheBox_Olaf_and_Noor/feedback/GraphBox.jpeg)

**3.	Can you understand and explain the analysis procedure to a third person?**  
    Yes.

**4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate?**  
    Ravi cut his fingers. Handles on the front panel would be nice.

**5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those without contacting the owners?**  
    We did have some issues but could figure it out on our own.

**6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?**  
    The simplicity was very nice.

### Interactions:
 
**1.	Could you relate to the stated goal of the project?**  
    Yes it would be nice to have a box with all features implemented.

**2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?**  
    Nothing.

**3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?**  
    Not really. We did not clearly understand what the goal was. Also, there was no way to check whether the features people asked for were implemented, because there was no list of what they initially asked for. Would be nice to be able check what you heard from people.
    
**4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?**  
    Implement what people asked for a bit better. For example, there need to be holes for cables and such to the outside of the box. Also implement handles on the front for better handling of the box.
