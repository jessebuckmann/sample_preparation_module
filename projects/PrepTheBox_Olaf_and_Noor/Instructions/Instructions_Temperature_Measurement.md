# Temperature measurement

In this section we discuss a small, quantitative experiment we have done in order to test whether one of our plans for The Box™ will work once the total module is operational. We have ran an experiment that will be explained below, and we will discuss the results, and draw conclusions whether something must change in our desing.

## Aim of the experiment

The experiment we chose to carry out is one that will test whether The Box™ needs additional (active) ventilation. We expect that especially the modules and power supply components will generate quite some heat, and we are worried that the heat cannot escape The Box™. By carrying out two measurement-sets (one with The Box™ completely closed and taped off with dukttape to make it waterproof, and one with two panels opposite to each other slightly shifted down, so that airflow is possible (passive ventilation)). In both measurement-sets, the temperature will be monitored and plotted afterwards.
