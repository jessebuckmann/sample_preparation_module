## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)

For me I hope to learn more about how to design experiments.
To be a bit more explicit I hope to learn how to create a clever design and how to construct this in a smart and efficient way.
I am also hoping on encountering some problems along the way which make me think on how to solve these
(e.g. too many vibrations or a very small signal) I feel these sort of things are very important
in experimental physics and I hope to learn more about this by doing it myself.

Besides this I hope to have some practice in collaborating with others on a larger project. Many large
experimental setups these days are collaborations between multiple universities and companies. Our project
will be of a smaller scale but nevertheless we will need to collaborate between groups. I hope to gain some
experience in this during the course, finding effective ways of communicating.


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them.
State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.*

The sub-project of prep the box gave, and gives, me a lot of oppertunities to work together with all the sub-groups
Noor and I had to communicate with everyone to see what they needed in terms of space and other features inside the box.
This was not always smooth sailing since everyone in essence wants the optimal scenario for their sub-project, which is not always the best for the entire group.
I do think we managed to find suitable solutions for each group and created a box-design in which everyone can make their own sub-project work.

We have encountered quite some problems along the way, which we needed to solve with help from the experts.
Most of these had to do with time and recource constraints (there is only so much you can do in a course of 10 weeks).
But also some ideas we had were simply not viable. This project is quite hands-on and does not necessarily have that much to do with physics.
Therefor the goal of having to fix problems such as vibrations or noise in an experiment will not be met in this project. 
In turn I do get to fix a lot of other, more practical, problems from which I can learn a lot as well.


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
