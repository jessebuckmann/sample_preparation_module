**Personal goals at the beginning of the course**

- Becoming better with Python, mainly using the terminal. I am quite experienced in C and C#, but I would like to expand my knowledge to Python. I have worked with it before during the Modern Condensed Matter course, but I am not too good at it (yet!). I would like to become more experienced at it. 

- Learning to work on a big project in a group. During our bachelor studies we did not do a lot of projects in groups (stand alone in groups bigger than 2 or 3 persons), though this is a skill one would need later in life. This course is a perfect playing ground to become acquinted with this. 

- Learning to work in collaborative projects during a pandemic. Hopefully, this pandemic will be the last in the coming years, but it does learn us how to work on (group) projects remotely. 

**Midterm evaluation of the goals**

- The Python goals is slightly altered, as we as team Box do not work that much with Python. I did however learn a lot from Aron's lecture, and I have practiced somewhat with labphew myself. 

- I think the big project goal is going quite well. I like gaining experience in a group project like this, even though it sometimes gives us quite some stress and irritations :)

- The pandemic goal is also going quite well. The cohort meetings and i.e. discussions about wearing mouth masks raise awareness for these measures, and I think the group is resepcting each others boundaries.
