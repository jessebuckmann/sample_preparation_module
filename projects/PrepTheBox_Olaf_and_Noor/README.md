# Welcome! ☀️

Welcome to the Prep The Box project folder! In this folder you can find all the information concerning our project. In this readme an introduction to our project and its importance will be given. As well as an overview of the general structure of our maps. Finally some information is added for people who want to repeat some of the measurements we performed on the box. We hope you can find everything you need based on this information and that you will be just as enthousiastic about this project as we are.

Kind regards, ciao and cheerio
