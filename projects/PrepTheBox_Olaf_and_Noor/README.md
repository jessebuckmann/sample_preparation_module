# Welcome! ☀️

Welcome to the Prep The Box project folder! In this folder you can find all the information concerning our project. In this readme an introduction to our project and its importance will be given. As well as an overview of the general structure of our maps. Finally some information is added for people who want to repeat some of the measurements we performed on the box. We hope you can find everything you need based on this information and that you will be just as enthousiastic about this project as we are.

Kind regards, ciao and cheerio

Olaf and Noor

## Introduction to the project

As a part of the course Experiment Design 2020 we, together with the other participants, had to choose a large project to execute. As a group we choose to design and construct an off-grid measurement system. The general idea of the measurement system is that it can be placed almost anywhere in the world to conduct experiments at that spot. It has to be self sufficient and able to withstand certain weather conditions. This large project was divided into several sub-projects, each of its own importance.

Noor and I chose for the prep the box project, in which we will construct and prepare the framework of the box. In coordination with the other project-groups we decided to have an entire modular box. The modularity of the box ensures that the off-grid measurement lab could be used by many types of scientists and for many different experiments. All these different modules will be build based on certain standardised measures. This ensures that wherever the box is placed, every scientist is able to place its own modules in the box and perform his or her experiment.

The succes and importance of modularity and standardised measures are evident in modern science and socieity. To give two examples: Global trade would never have flourished as it has without standardising the size of shipping containers and in modern particle physics experiments as the Large Hadron Collider the use the same type of hardware modules in all experiments. This means hardware modules designed and tested in Utrecht will work just as well at an experiment in Japan.

## Structure of the folders

In this section we will shortly describe the content of all the folders in this project map, to help you find your way in our folders.

- Instructions: This folder contains all the necessary information if you would like to repeat some of the experiments we conducted during the design of the box
- Mentor_Meetings: This folder contains the summaries of the meetings we had with our mentor, Dante Killian, and other experts.
- Personal_Files: This folder contains the personal files of us both, such as our personal goals.
-Roadmap_map: This folder contains information on the development of our project during the course. Think of files such as our schedule, our project canvas and our project goals. But also things such as a sketch of the box and celebration art pieces.
-Technical_Details: This folder contains the technical details of our project such as a list of components and the dimensions of the box.

## Information on repeating measurements

During this project many descisions had to be made concerning the design of the box. All of these were made after consulting the other project groups and some experts on the subject. For one design desicion we performed an experiment to see what the most effective solution would be. We performed an experiment to see if ventilation would be necessary in the box. To test this we measured the temperature inside the box after placing two beakers with boiling water inside, once without ventilation and once with passive ventilation. If one would want to repeat this experiment, the instructions can be found in the [Instructions folder]().
