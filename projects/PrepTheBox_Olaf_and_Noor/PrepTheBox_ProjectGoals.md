# Project goals for Prep The Box

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball 
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors


## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*Fill here what you expect to achieve with the project. Try to make quantitive goals when possible.*
+ Make the box water tight
+ Add a water tight door to the box
+ Create two compartments. The top will be for the support modules. The bottom will house the experiment modules
+ Create a pointy roof for the solar panels
+ Create a (railed) slot system for the support modules
+ Create a spot for the screen
+ Create a spot for the power and usb outlet

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note your progress and re-adjust your goals such that you can deliver at the end*
Update related to the previous goals:
+ Box is designed to be watertight by putting dukttape on the gaps when an experiment is about to be ran. Has to be tested.
+ Door is not going to be added, instead we keep the setup with three plates being able to be removed (they stick to the box with magnets)
+ Compartments have been made, and are separated from one another with a wooden plates
+ Roof is scrapped during our discussions with the power supply group
+ We have added an support bar for the railing system
+ Screen is scrapped during our discussions with the hardware/software teams


Goals for now:
+ Quantitatively test physical aspects of the box (test level, test temperature in box, test watertightness)
+ Add the railing system to the bar
+ Add the legs to the added bars for the level requirement


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
