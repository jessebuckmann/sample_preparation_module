**The Subproject Collection**
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
From initial ideas, over collecting information from the cohort, to a serious planðŸ˜‰. 
Put the pieces together: 

The Hardware group likes to connect all parts of the box with a "master" device if possible. 
We need certain information from all of you and and some details which may not be further specified yet.

**Box-Design**

*Offers to you/Uses*
- Note: all measurements are made in meters. Next to that, one needs to substract some distance from both sides due to the precense of the frame of the box. The frame beams are approximately 4 cm wide.
- Top: Height: 0.90, Width 0.75
- Side: Height: 0.92, Width: 0.75, Heigth Legs: 0.25
- Side as seen from the front: Height: 0.92, Width: 0.90, Height Legs: 0.25

*Compartment size*
- Experiment compartment: Height: 55.3 cm
- Module compartment: Height: 37.2 cm
- Module box sizes are approximately 601036 cm

*Needs from you*

**Software Group**

*Offers to you/Uses*
- Transformation from analg/digital input to digital/analog output
- Interfacing

*Needs from you*
- An input and output possibility for the Analog Discovery 2 by Digilent (**Hardware**)
- A general overview tab (**here**?)
- Maybe 2 x 1 to 4 [USB](https://www.aulola.co.uk/4-port-usb-hub-usb-20-round-usb-splitter-box-with-long-cable-black-p19122.html) **Hardware** 
- Text base commands from adrino device **Experiment**

**Inputs**:

 **Power Supply**

 *Offers to you/Uses*
 - Battery with solar and [solar charge controller](https://www.conrad.nl/p/steca-solarix-prs-2020-solar-laadregelaar-serie-12-v-24-v-20-a-110704)
 - Control of power consumption/central shut down: **Hardware** creates short-circuit and **Software** the corresponding *'safety-code'*

 *Needs from you*
 - The details concerning the energy for your experimental performance/measurement
 - Operating voltage
 - Power usage
 - Is input DC or AC?
 - Additional information if possible (Stability, voltage oscillations, cold start current)
 - Charge controller which requires 10cm above and below it for ventilation and safety, as well as some room to able to attach and detach cables on the bottom **Box**
 - 2*2 pin inputs to measure voltage for voltage control
