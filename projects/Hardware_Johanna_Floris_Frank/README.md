**Welcome To The Hardware Project!** :raised_hands:

We, **Johanna**, **Frank** and **Floris** are the members of the Hardware-Group :v: .
The Hardware-Group aims to connect the techical parts of the box and to provide the experimentalists with a fast and save data transfer.

Therefore we try to **collect** many informations about *your expectations* for the overall box, as well as the details of your subdevices in the [subproject_collection](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/subproject_collection.md). You can find a rough idea from our first brainstorm of the possible connections, which will be dynamically adjusted to fullfill the requirements you set to the hardware!
With **your contributions** this file will result as usefull **overview of the grand Project** for all groups, but it first of all aims to facilitate the start for the software group.

After collecting all the information it is our turn to get some **physical work** done. 
We will wire all parts together and perform some **initial tests** of the data transfer and bandwidth, before you can run your experiments.

Let's get this started :fire: !

**Cheerio !** :grin:
