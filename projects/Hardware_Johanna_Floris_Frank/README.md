**Welcome To The Hardware Project!**

We, **Johanna**, **Frank** and **Floris** are the members of the Hardware-Group.
The Hardware group likes to connect all parts of the box with a "master" device if possible. 

We first try to *collect* many informations about *your expectations* for the overall box, as well as the details of your subdevices in the file (Issues: https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/issues/1 and if this doesn't work, the directory: [subproject_collection](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/subproject_collection.md)). You can find a rough idea from our first brainstorm of the possible connections, which will be dynamically adjusted to fullfill the requirements you set to the hardware!
This file should devellop as usefull *overview of the grand Project* for all groups, but it first of all aims to facilitate the start for the software group.
Please answear all the questions as soon as possible such that we can start planning our work for you! 
If you are not sure about all the answears yet, no worries - You can always add things that come to your mind and discuss solotions with us or the whole cohort.

After collecting all the information it is our turn to get some *physical work* done. 
We will wire all parts together and perform some *initial tests* of the data transfer, before you can run your experiments.

Let's get this started !

**Cheerio !**
