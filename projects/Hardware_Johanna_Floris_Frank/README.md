**Welcome To The Hardware Project!** :raised_hands:

We, **Johanna**, **Frank** and **Floris** are the members of the Hardware-Group :v: .
The Hardware-Group aims to connect the techical parts of the box and to provide the experimentalists with a fast and save data transfer. 
A more detailed report on context and theory may be found [here](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/Report_on_context_and_theory.md).

Therefore we try to **collect** many informations about *your expectations* for the overall box, as well as the details of your subdevices in the [subproject_collection](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/subproject_collection.md). You can find a rough idea from our first brainstorm of the possible connections, which will be dynamically adjusted to fullfill the requirements you set to the hardware!
With **your contributions** this file will result as usefull **overview of the grand Project** for all groups, but it first of all aims to facilitate the start for the software group.

After collecting all the information it is our turn to get some **physical work** done. 
We will try to **connect the several Arduinos**, used for your measurements, to one or two master pieces. That way we can (hopefully) provide the software group with all data from the enviromental and experimental measurements in one or two data streams. We will also help the software group to test their interfaces and progress with some dummy experiments, before you finished your sensors and experimental setups. 
We will (not necessarily) wire all parts together and perform some more **initial tests** of the data transfer and bandwidth, before you can run your experiments.

Let's get this started :fire: !

**Cheerio !** :grin:
