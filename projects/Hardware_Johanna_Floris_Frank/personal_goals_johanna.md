*Initial Personal Goals*
- I would like to create something that is useful for many people.
- From the course I expect to learn more about how to start and organize a project where many people are working together. This includes the (hopefully) well structured communication within our sub-group, as well as the information exchange with the whole course.
- For the subproject I expect to learn way more about electronics, data transfer and how to connect diffrent sub-systems with each other.
- I also hope to learn some dutch - teach me guys!

*I. review of goals* (fill this mid-course)

*I learned for so far*
- That the size of a gruop makes the communication more difficult
- What an Arduino is and how to get some measurments done with it
- 2 sentences in dutch (with bad accent)

The course structure did not influence my personal goals - but the goals of my group.
It would be nice if you either coordinate the whole course or stop destroying all progress that we made in the first days. This sounds horrible :fearful: , but it leads to a new personal goal :grin:

- I shoul work on my patience to maintaine a good group atmosphere - Sorry guys :wink:
- For the subproject I have to learn way more about Arduino libraries electronics and data transfer
- I should learn more useful sentences in ducht :smile:
