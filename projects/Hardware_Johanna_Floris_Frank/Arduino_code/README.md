<h1>Arduino Code</h1>
This folder contains the files to upload to the Arduinos in the smaller experiments.

<h2>BME</h2>
BME.ino can be uploaded to an Arduino connected to a single (BME) sensor. This Arduino then reads the sensor output directly.

<h2>Hybrid<h2/>
The hybrid experiment assumes multiple Arduinos being able to send and recieve data. Hybrid_Master.ino can be uploaded to an Arduino, which then acts as the master Arduino requesting data from subscriber (slave) Arduinos and showing this data. Hybrid_Slave.ino can be uploaded to Arduinos connected to (BME) sensors. These subscribers then reads the sensors and gives the data to the master upon request.
