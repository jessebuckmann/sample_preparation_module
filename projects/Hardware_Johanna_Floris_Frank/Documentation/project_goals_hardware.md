**Utrecht Experiment Design 2020**

**Project goals**
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
*POP*


*Purpose*: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball

*Outcome(s)*: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project

*Process*: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

Project Name: **HARDWARE**
Members: **Johanna**, **Frank** and **Floris**

**Initial Project Goals**

- Provide the hardware for data transfer/display​ of the measurements with an adequate number of inputs and components the software group can run their program on
- Achieve minimal noise levels in the central wiring facility
- Collecting/structure ideas of the Cohort ​to make them mutually compatible though the central facility
- Install the hardware ​

*How to achieve them*

- Outline the parts of experiment(s)​
- Collecting whats needed,​
- Wire the sub and central facillities ​and fit them into the 'box'
- Measure signal to noise ratio and set-up bandwidth using a dummy signal/dataset

**I. Review of goals** 

- Provide the hardware for data transfer/display​ of the measurements with an adequate number of inputs and components the software group can run their program on
- Provide the software group with a small data set/ transfer to test their code
- Combine Arduinos and their outputs, such that the software group can readout only one Arduino
- Find a possibility to easily store the data 

*How to achieve them*
- Outline the parts of the experiment(s): figure out how many Arduinos and what file type they will send
- Connect maximal number of slaves or even direct sensors to one master
- Use dummy experiments and work with the software group to verify how well the data is transferred/stored
