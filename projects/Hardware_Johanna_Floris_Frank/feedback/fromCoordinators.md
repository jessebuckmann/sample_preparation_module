# Week 4 discussion

Team Johanna, Frank, Floris

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ Readme is on a good track, can be more inviting though, folder structure is not so deliberately set
+ How much have you thought of easing the contributions?
+ How are the individual roles defined and arranged?

### Conversation on the progress status

+ be deliberate on assigning tasks
+ separate your demonstration from the service you will provide the grand project
+ focus on the process and not the final product
