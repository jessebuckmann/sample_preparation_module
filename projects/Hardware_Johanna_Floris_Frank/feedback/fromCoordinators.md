# Week 4 discussion

Team Johanna, Frank, Floris

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ Readme is on a good track, can be more inviting though, folder structure is not so deliberately set
+ How much have you thought of easing the contributions?
+ How are the individual roles defined and arranged?

### Conversation on the progress status

+ be deliberate on assigning tasks
+ separate your demonstration from the service you will provide the grand project
+ focus on the process and not the final product

Motivated me to read further and had at least one link how to get involved, but not all the elements were linked so I quickly got lost. The big picture of the project is there, but i cannot see any detail of where to start learning and what is the latest state.
