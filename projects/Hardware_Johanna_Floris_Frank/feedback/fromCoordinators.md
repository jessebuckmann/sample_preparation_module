# Week 4 discussion

Team Johanna, Frank, Floris

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ Readme is on a good track, can be more inviting though, folder structure is not so deliberately set
+ How much have you thought of easing the contributions?
+ How are the individual roles defined and arranged?

### Conversation on the progress status

+ be deliberate on assigning tasks
+ separate your demonstration from the service you will provide the grand project
+ focus on the process and not the final product

⭐⭐⭐☆☆
Motivated me to read further and had at least one link how to get involved, but not all the elements were linked so I quickly got lost. The big picture of the project is there, but i cannot see any detail of where to start learning and what is the latest state.
use of emoji's is 🔥 


### on Instructions (timestamp: 12/10/2020 ~15h)
⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
Very point-by-point. Clear attention for safety considerations. Project seems to consist of 3 different parts which are discussed seperately. The required wiring is sometimes a bit vague. It was easy to find the instructions.
