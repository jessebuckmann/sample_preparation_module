**Week 5**

*Monday*

- **Before Monday**: everyone learns about [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/MasterReader) and [communication protocols](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI), and come up with ideas to implement with arduino on Monday
- Keep on track with transferring info from the [issues](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/issues) in the UED repo to our [subproject_collection](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/subproject_collection.md)
- **On Monday**, collect the hardware to/and perform simple experiments with the arduino and work towards understanding and developing the communication protocol/tests
- Clarify open questions from the other groups (Software, Power)
- Small adjustments for the [README](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/README.md) and [project goal](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/project_goals_hardware.md) as well es setting the further [project_schedule](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/project_schedule.md). If there is still some time left work on that graph in [subproject_collection](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.lomker/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/Hardware_Johanna_Floris_Frank/subproject_collection.md) :)

*Wednesday*
- Meeting with Tijmen & Co

*Thursday*
- **Until Thursday** Issues or in general all the documentation issues that may be left from Monday
- Figure out how to connect several measurments/arduinos with each other.

*Friday/Weekend*
