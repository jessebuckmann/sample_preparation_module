## Instructions:
Before you can use the box, you have to attach the retractable pipe to the pvc pipe.
This attaches by friction so you can just slide the retractable pipe over the pvc pipe.
After this, you have to attach the black wire to the - and the yellow wire to the + of the 12V battery from the power group.
Now the box is ready for use!

You can find the description of the testing in [this](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing) directory.
For borrowing the anemometers you should contact Pascal Koopman (p.koopman@uu.nl).
For repeating the chemical resistance test you should contact Jesper Moes (j.r.moes@uu.nl) from CMI, or reach out to someone else with access to the lab. Feel free to also do additional tests. These were the chemicals we had readily available and we thought would be nice to test since they are the typical solvents that are used along with some common acids. 

### Safety Instructions
When testing the chemical resistance of the coated wood, you should wear a lab coat and safety goggles. For some actions you may have to wear acid resistant gloves. The lab supervisor will tell you when you need to wear gloves. A lab coat and safety goggles can be borrowed from the lab. As also mentioned in the coating_testing file, you should always add water to your beaker first and then the acid.

When using chemicals you should look up the msds safety sheets of each chemical. Because you are working in small quantities, the safety instructions come down to washing your skin under cold running water for 10 minutes in case of a spill. When chemicals come into contact with your eye you should wash your eyes with water as well.
In the scenario where you spill acid elsewhere try to remove as much as possible by pipetting it up, if only a bit of acid is left you can dilute it with water and wipe it up with paper.
Make sure to wash your hands after performing any testing since trace amounts of chemicals may be left on your hands. 

When using the 12V battery there is a small risk of the battery exploding when short-circuiting it. Carefully attaching the wires as described above will not allow you to short-circuit it.

#### Aqua Regia
Aqua Regia (King's Water) is an acid which is famous for being able to dissolve nobel metals such as gold and platinum, hence the regia in its name. It consists of a 3:1 molar ratio of hydrochloric: nitric acid and is yellow of color. You should ask one of the lab supervisors to make it for you. We asked Naud van Bunningen (a.j.vanbunningen@uu.nl) to help us prepare it.

### Finn Pipet
In this section we will give a small instruction on how to use a Finn pipet. There are different models of Finn pipets that enable you to pipet different quantities of liquids. The pipet that you will need can pipet a volume of 1-5ml. The quantity can be changed by turning the knob at the end. For some pipets you need to pull this back before you are able to turn it. Add a plastic tip to the pipet when you want to start pipetting. When you push the knob you will encounter two 'stops', try it a couple times to see if you feel it. When you want to suck up liquid you push until you reach the first stop. During the entire pipetting process you should keep your pipet vertical. Now place your pipet point in the liquid and slowly release the knob to suck up the liquid. To squirt out the liquid again push until the second stop while keeping the pipet point against your glass at an angle of approximately 40Â°. When pipetting a volume for the first time, follow this procedure in the beaker containing the liquid you wish to pipet, before you pipet it to another beaker. This is because there is always some residual liquid in the pipet tip after pipeting. This also means that you have to keep your pipet tip pointing downwards. Work up in increasing volumes, to keep the pipetting as accurately as possible. When you are done pipetting a specific substance you can dispose the tip by pressing the ejector button next to the knob. 

If you think this explanation is too complicated and would rather see an [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGX490kuKjg) feel free to watch it. This might also help visualising the process.
