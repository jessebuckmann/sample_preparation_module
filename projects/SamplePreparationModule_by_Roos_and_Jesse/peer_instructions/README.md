##### Welcome to the reproduction directory!

In this section we will try and guide you through the procedure of how the preparation module was tested. Before we tell you more about how to test everything we ask that you first read the [instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/peer_instructions/instructions.md). In the [instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/peer_instructions/instructions.md) you are able to find some contact information when you want to perform experiments on campus. It includes [safety instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/peer_instructions/instructions.md) which must read before performing any testing. Finally, it includes instructions on how to use a Finn pipet if you are unfamiliar on how to use this.

The information that will be provided below is centred around testing the sample preparation module. Additional information about how the sample preparation module was build can be found in the [building process](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/project_details/building_progress.md). We also have a [cost breakdown](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/project_details/cost_breakdown.md) if you are interested in the total price of building a fumehood yourself. The [goal of the project](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/project_details/project_goals.md) was to building a fumehood that is ventilated and chemically resistant. We will now bring you through the steps of how to perform this testing. 

Have you read the [instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/peer_instructions/instructions.md)? If not, please do so. Otherwise feel free to continue. We have split up the testing process in two components.

### Coating testing

In order to perform any tests of the coating you will first need access to a lab equipped to work with acids. If you have connections to such a lab you can also go there. If not you can contact Jesper Moes (j.r.moes@uu.nl) and make an appointment.
In order to perform the testing we have supplied you with an additional piece of wood that is also coated with the polyurethane coating. This is supplied with the box. The side that has our test results on it has been coated and the left side of the wood is for the reproduction of our test. 
Before you go into the lab make sure that you are wearing a lab coat and safety goggles as instructed in the [safety instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/peer_instructions/instructions.md).

When you have to clean up there are four waste containers. Acids, anorganic substances, organic halogen rich, organic halogen poor.
While working with acids you have to dispose your waste in the acids container, while working with acetone, ethanol or toluene you have to dispose your waste in organic halogen poor.

#### Testing with nitric acid:
- Read the entire instructions first so you can prepare all glass work and tools you need. You might also want to label your glass work so you know what it contains.
- Fill a glass beaker with 10ml nitric acid.
- Make 10%, 25% and 50% diluted concentrations. This is done by adding demi water.
1. For 10% add 9ml demi water to a second glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 1ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% nitric acid.
2. For 25% add 7.5ml demi water to a third glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 2.5ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% nitric acid.
3. For 50% add 5ml demiwater to a fourth glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 5ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% nitric acid.
- Before pipeting acid concentrations onto the testing wood, you want to stir it with a glass pasteur pipet, to prevent any outlying high acid concentrations.
- Indicate what you are testing on the wood using a pencil.
- Pipet approximately 1ml of acid onto the wood next to your indication, use a different pasteur pipet for each acid. You are using a pasteur pipet which does not allow for a quantative measurement.
- Leave every concentration on the wood for 5 minutes before removing it with an pasteur pipet and disposing it in an additional 'waste' glass beaker.
- There will be a small residual amount of acid left so you can pipet a little bit of water on the spot as well and dispose this in the same 'waste beaker'.
- Wipe the area you have tested with a paper tissue to remove any of the already diluted acid or water that may still be left on the wood. 
- Empty your glass beakers and waste in the designated container. Clean them using demiwater, ethanol and alcohol. If you don't have any lab experience ask the supervisor if he can help you.

#### Testing with hydrochloric acid:
- Read the entire instructions first so you can prepare all glass work and tools you need. You might also want to label your glass work so you know what it contains.
- Fill a glass beaker with 10ml hydrochloric acid.
- Make 10%, 25% and 50% diluted concentrations. This is done by adding demi water.
1. For 10% add 9ml demi water to a second glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 1ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% hydrochloric acid.
2. For 25% add 7.5ml demi water to a third glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 2.5ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% hydrochloric acid.
3. For 50% add 5ml demiwater to a fourth glass beaker using an Finn Pipet. Add 5ml, using an Finn pipet, of 100% hydrochloric acid.
- Before pipeting acid concentrations onto the testing wood, you want to stir it with a glass pasteur pipet, to prevent any outlying high acid concentrations.
- Indicate what you are testing on the wood using a pencil.
- Pipet approximately 0.5-1ml of acid onto the wood next to your indication, use a different pasteur pipet for each acid. You are using a pasteur pipet which does not allow for a quantative measurement.
- Leave every concentration on the wood for 5 minutes before removing it with an pasteur pipet and disposing it in an additional 'waste' glass beaker.
- There will be a small residual amount of acid left so you can pipet a little bit of water on the spot as well and dispose this in the same 'waste beaker'.
- Wipe the area you have tested with a paper tissue to remove any of the already diluted acid or water that may still be left on the wood. 
- Empty your glass beakers and waste in the designated container. Clean them using demiwater, ethanol and alcohol. If you don't have any lab experience ask the supervisor if he can help you.



#### Testing with ethanol and acetone:
- Read the entire instructions first so you can prepare all glass work and tools you need. You might also want to label your glass work so you know what it contains.
- Fill two glass beaker with approximately 2ml ethanol and acetone repectively.
- Indicate the region on the wood where you are going to test.
- Using a pasteur pipet, pipet approximately 0.5-1ml ethanol and acetone on the wood regions you indicated in the previous step.
- Leave it for 5 minutes, before removing it with an pasteur pipet and disposing it in an additional 'waste' glass beaker.
- Wipe the wood with a paper tissue. 
- clean your glass work and your waste container, in the designated container. If you don't have any lab experience ask the supervisor if he can help you.

#### Testing with Aqua Regia:
- Ask for assistance from a lab supervisor. In our case Naud van Bunningen (a.j.vanbunningen@uu.nl) was present. 
- You will need two glass beakers: one containing 5ml of hydrochloric acid and 1 containing 1 ml of nitric acid.
- Indicate a region on the wood where you want to test.
- Ask supervisor to pipet 0.5-1ml aqua regia onto the wood in the region you have indicated.
- Leave it for five minutes before asking the supervisor to remove it.
- Clean with a bit of demiwater before wiping with a paper tissue.
- Cleaning requires extra safety gloves. Ask supervisor for help.


#### Testing with Toluene:
- Read the entire instructions first so you can prepare all glass work and tools you need. You might also want to label your glass work so you know what it contains.
- Toluene evaporates very quickly, do not inhale fumes, you will need an beaker glass that you can close completely. Experiment has to be peformed in a fumehood.
- Fill beaker glass with lid with approximately 2 ml of toluene and immediately close the lid.
- Indicate where you want to pipet your toluene.
- Use a pasteur pipet to pipet 0.5-1ml toluene into the region you have indicated. Close the beaker glass immediately afterwards.
- Close the fumehood and leave it for 5 minutes.
- If not all toluene has evaporated you can put it back in the glas beaker with lid before wiping it with a paper tissue.
- Clean your glass work and deposit your toluene in the designated container. If you have no lab experience you can ask the supervisor to help you.

In addition to these step-by-step procedures you can find our test results and steps in the [coating testing file](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing/testing_coating.md)
