### Instructions:
Before you can use the box, you have to attach the retractable pipe to the pvc pipe.
This attaches by friction so you can just slide the retractable pipe over the pvc pipe.
After this, you have to attach the black wire to the - and the yellow wire to the + of the 12V battery from the power group.
Now the box is ready for use!

You can find the description of the testing in [this](https://git.science.uu.nl/j.i.buckmann/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing) directory.
For borrowing the anemometers you should contact Pascal Koopman (p.koopman@uu.nl).
For repeating the chemical resistance test you should contact Jesper Moes (j.r.moes@uu.nl) from CMI, or reach out to someone else with access to the lab. Feel free to also do additional tests. These were the chemicals we had readily available and we thought would be nice to test since they are the typical solvents that are used along with some common acids.
