# Reproducibility report

## Experiment/team: 
Sample preparation box by Roos and Jesse

## Reviewers: 
Mikita, Floris

## Report 

### Documentation:

1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.
2.	Were the safety instructions clear?
- Instructions on prevention itself were clear, most notably on the preventive equipment one should wear while working with acids
- When working with acids (or rather potentially dangerous chemicals in general), one should add instructions on what to do if something goes wrong, e.g. when you spill, specifically when spilling on your skin. Currently, this is missing.
- Apparently, the safety instructions of the power supply group mentions the possibility of the battery exploding if it is short-circuited. 
3.	How helpful is the documentation for reproducing the measurement?
4.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
- For the battery, it was mentioned the power supply group should be asked. The power supply group had to be asked for a battery.
5.	Are you guided to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?
6.	What can be improved in the documentation?

### Measurements:

1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?

Air flow measurement using the testo anemoniter, except when mentioned otherwise:

|position|windspeed (m/s) provided by experiment|windspeed (m/s) measured by 
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
|in the room we were measuring in| 0.00|0.00|
|sides of the box without ductape| 0.00| (1)|
|sides of top window|0.00||
|sides of front window|0.00||
|end of the pipe (testo)| 1.60||
|end of the pipe (kaindl)| 1.7||
|end of the pipe (travel&co)| 1.6||
|front of sash while fully opened|0.20||
|front of sash when almost closed|1.12||
|middle of hood| 0.23||
|right middle of hood| 0.04||
|left middle of hood| 0.04||
|inside hood right below fan| 0.66||
|inside hood side of fan| 0.52||

(1) not possible to take ductape of

3.	Can you understand and explain the analysis procedure to a third person?
4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those without contacting the owners?
6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?

### Interactions:

1.	Could you relate to the stated goal of the project?
2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?
3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?
4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?
