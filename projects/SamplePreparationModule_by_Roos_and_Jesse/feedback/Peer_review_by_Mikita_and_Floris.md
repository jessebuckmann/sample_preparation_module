## Report 

### Documentation:

1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.
- The purpose itself is quite clear: make a well-ventilated and chemically resistant box, such that it functions as a small and lower-budget fumehood, which fits in the larger experiment box.

2.	Were the safety instructions clear?
- Instructions on prevention itself were clear, most notably on the preventive equipment one should wear while working with acids.
- When working with potentially dangerous chemicals, one should add instructions on what to do if something goes wrong, e.g. when you spill on your skin. Currently, this is missing. However, this is presumed to be not a sefety issue since the instructions state these tests need to be carried out under supervision.
- Apparently, the safety instructions of the power supply group mentions the possibility of the battery exploding if it is short-circuited. When simply connecting the two wires of the fan, we presume the risk of exploding is non-existent if you connect the wires normally, but perhaps it is good to mention this explicitly to avoid suprises.

3.	How helpful is the documentation for reproducing the measurement?
- Starting from the readme, it is not so clear where to begin with the peer-reviewing. In the readme, perhaps it's good to explicitly link to the instuction file.
- The measurement description itself is perfectly suited for repeating the measurments, it is just a bit unclear how to get the necessities (both the battery and the acces to the chemical lab).

4.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
- The battery needed required to get the fan running, and thus required for the airflow measurments. However, the battery was in use for the peer-reviewing power supply group, so that on Monday we were unable to do the airflow measurment. This was not mentioned in the documentation, and an alternative power source (12V battery) was not provided.

5.	Are you guided to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?
- Starting from the readme file of the project folder, one is guided more towards an understaning of the project goals. When following the peer-review instructions, one is guided towards the testing documentation, but not towards the building process documentation.
- The structure of the repository itself is quite simple and therefore easy and pleasant to navigate through, which is further augmented by cross-references from the readme and peer instructions to the  

6.	What can be improved in the documentation?
- Link to peer instructions in the readme file.
- Explicitly mention and refer to the documentation on the building process in the instruction.

### Measurements:

1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
- Yes, as soon as the necesarry equipment is required.

2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?
- The required battery was unavailable since the group peer-reviewing the power supply experiment needed it as well
- Air flow measurement using the testo anemoniter, except when mentioned otherwise:

|position|windspeed (m/s) provided by experiment|windspeed (m/s) measured by 
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
|in the room we were measuring in| 0.00|0.00|
|sides of the box without ductape| 0.00|(1)|
|sides of top window|0.00|0.00|
|sides of front window|0.00|0.00|
|end of the pipe (testo)| 1.60|0.43 (window closed), 1.01 (window open) (2)|
|end of the pipe (kaindl)| 1.7|(3)|
|end of the pipe (travel&co)| 1.6|0.50 (window closed), 1.4 (window open) (2)|
|front of sash while fully opened|0.20|0.19|
|front of sash when almost closed|1.12|0.94|
|middle of hood| 0.23|0.07|
|right middle of hood| 0.04|0.05|
|left middle of hood| 0.04|0.05|
|inside hood right below fan| 0.66|0.40|
|inside hood side of fan| 0.52|(4)|

(1) We did not feel comfortable taking the ductape off, so this measurement was not repeated. Also not clear where in the box.
(2) Instructions not clear if the window is to be open or to be closed during measurements
(3) Sensor not present
(4) Location not clear

3.	Can you understand and explain the analysis procedure to a third person?
- The analysis processes on chemical resistance and windspeed itself are well-documented and quite simple, so explaining to a third person is very much doable.

4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
- The set-up itself is robust and safe to operate.
- The chemical testing of the coating is safe for someone who also studied chemistry, and safe under adequate supervision for someone who studied only physics.

5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those without contacting the owners?
- The battery necesarry for the airflow measurements was also used by power supply group. In the end we were able to use the battery after the group peer-reviewing the power supply gorup had finished.
- Testing of the coating required making an appointment with Jesper, which we were not able to do on Monday
- Some of the locations on the 

6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?
- 

### Interactions:

1.	Could you relate to the stated goal of the project?
- Yes, see also answer to question 1 under documentation.

2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?
- Help on finding the battery in the power supply group box.
- Finding out if there was a readily available alternative power source in case the battery was in use by the power supply group.

3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?
- Yes, the box is present, and according to measurments by the group itself it is well-ventilated and the coated wood is reasonable resistant to most chemicals studied.

4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?
- Find a separate battery/power supply so you're not dependant upon the power supply group and you can do experiments simultaneosly.
- Alter the readme file of your folder so one is more guided towards reproducing the experiment.
- Within the instructions, also mention the building process and link to it. Even though it will be a bit far-fetched to repeat the entire building process, it is good to have an idea on e.g. what materials you used in the production of your box.
- Better describe the locations you measured the airflow.
