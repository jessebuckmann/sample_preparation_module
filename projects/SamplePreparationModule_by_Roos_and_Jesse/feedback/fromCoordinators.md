⭐⭐☆☆☆
good that contributors are clear and some elements of the plan are identified.
dissapoiting a bit for the reader who want so engage, as if she is not welcome to read further!
what can the reader gain from engaging? why did you choose these goals? are you excited at all about what you're doing. These are the question I asked myself when opening your folder and was left with no answer.
