### Sample preperation module
by Jesse and Roos

The Sample preperation module is a module that can be added to the off-grid lab box to enable users to prepare samples without contaminations in a well ventilated area.
The box will be modular meaning that the user can perform multiple kinds of experiments within the box. The user can supply with the tools that are needed.

Main planned features:
- ventilated, to carry away fumes
- spill proof, make the worksurface chemical resistant
- air tight, making sure the fumes will only go out through the pipe
