### Sample preperation module
By Jesse and Roos

### Project description
In this project a Sample preparation module is build. It has some of the features typically found in a fumehood, but with an all new design. The sample preparation module enables the user to prepare samples without contaminations in a well ventilated area. The box will be modular, meaning that the user can perform multiple kinds of experiments within the box. The user can supply the tools that are needed for the specific experiment currently equiped in the off-grid lab. 

Typically a fumehood is a very expensive lab component. Looking at the [cost](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/project_details/cost_breakdown.md), designing your own fumehood might have several advantages. Obviously you need to live up to some of the general features a fumehood must have e.g. ventilation and chemically resistant worksurface. Besides being much cheaper, you can design the fumehood in a way to simplify the sample preparation you need to do.

For the general construction of the fumehood the [building progress](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/project_details/building_progress.md) is available, along with several [photos](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Photos) of the various stages of construction. While this construction might not live up to the features of a real fumehood, it does offer a degree of protection and a good working environment for the prepartion of some typical samples that are used in experiments.


Main features:
- [ventilated](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing/testing_airflow.md), to carry away fumes
- [spill proof](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing/testing_coating.md), the workspace has high chemical resistance.
- [air tight](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/SamplePreparationModule_by_Roos_and_Jesse/Testing/testing_airflow.md), ensure that the fumes will only go out through the pipe.
