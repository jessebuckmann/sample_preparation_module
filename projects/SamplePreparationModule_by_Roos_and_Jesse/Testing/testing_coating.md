Your workspace needs to be chemically resistant so that it doesn't get destroyed by the first small spill. We applied to layers of polyurethane coating to provide this chemical resistance. In order to test how good this actually protects your workspace we dropped various solvents and acids on a piece of testing wood that has the same polyurethane coating to see how resistant it actually is. Typically you would clean up within 5 minutes after spilling something so everything was left on for 5 minutes. The solvents that have been tested are:
- ethanol: No visible damage -> feel test after 24 hours
- acetone: No visible damage -> feel test after 24 hours
- toluene: No visible damage -> feel test after 24 hours
Most of these solvents evaporate pretty quickly especially toluene, which was completely gone after 5 minutes. The reason for leaving it 24 hours is that some of the solvent may have moved into the coating. Touching it at this point may be dangerous for yourself and it will still have an effect on the final result, therefore leave it for 24 hours. 

Two different acid concentration series have been tested: Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. 
The following concentrations have been measured:
- 10 % obtained by adding 1 ml of acid (100 %) to 9 ml of demiwater.
- 25 % obtained by adding 2.5 ml of acid (100 %) to 7.5 ml of demiwater.
- 50 % obtained by adding 5ml of acid (100 %) to 5ml of demiwater.
- 100 % taken from container that is available in the lab.
Note that the percentages here are based on the concentration that is available in the lab. We have used the standard university concentrations which are about 40 %, according to the lab assistant.
Prepare the samples by using a Finn pipet. For instructions on how to use a Finn pipet click here(ADD LINK!!!!) Keep in mind to always add the acid to the water and before dropping it onto the wood stir it with a pasteur pipet (simpler version of a Finn pipet). Take a clean pasteur pipet after each time you dripped some acid onto the wood to avoid messing up your concentrations.
Also leave these samples on the wood for approximately 5 minutes and the remove them with an pasteur pipet.

Finally aquaregia acid has been prepared and dropped onto the wood. This has only been done for the 100 % concentration since it consists of a 3:1 molar ratio of hydrochloric: nitric acid. This is famous for being able to dissolve all metals. You can ask someone to make this for you.
