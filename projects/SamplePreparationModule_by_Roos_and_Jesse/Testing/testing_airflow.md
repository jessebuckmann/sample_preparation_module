### Testing airflow
We tested the airflow of the box by using an anemometer.
Pascal provided us with 3 kinds of anemometers, one from travel&co, one from testo and a kaindl windmaster 2. 
The testo anemometer was the most accurate one and was therefore used for most of the measurements.
In the table underneath you can find the values for the windspeed we measured.
When the anemometer was in place, we waited a bit until the value for the windspeed stabalized a bit. 
After waiting for a while, the value on the anemometer still fluctuated a lot.
We think this might be due to the fan not rotating continuously.
Because of the fluctuations, an error of +- 0.1 should be taken into account for all measurements.

#### table 1: Measured windspeed values for different positions in and around the box.
|position|windspeed (m/s)|
| ------ | -------- |
|in the room we were measuring in| 0.00|
|sides of the box without ductape| 0.00|
|sides of top window|0.00|
|sides of front window|0.00|
|end of the pipe (testo)| 1.60|
|end of the pipe (kaindl)| 1.7|
|end of the pipe (travel&co)| 1.6|
|front of sash while fully opened|0.20|
|front of sash when almost closed|1.12|
|middle of hood| 0.23|
|right middle of hood| 0.04|
|left middle of hood| 0.04|
|inside hood right below fan| 0.66|
|inside hood side of fan| 0.52|

Based on these results there is no airflow through the sides of the box.
However, because of the large error of the anemometer and for extra safety we decided to tape the sides of the box with ductape anyway.
