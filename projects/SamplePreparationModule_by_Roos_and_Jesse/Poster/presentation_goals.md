# Experiment Design 2020

## Symposium self-reflection

project, team: Sample preparation module, Roos de Boer and Jesse Buckmann

The purpose of this self-reflection is to learn from the exercise of presenting your project to a public audience. Answer the preparation questions **before** the online symposium and evaluate them based on your experience **after** the end of the symposium

## Preparation

### Content: 
+	What makes your pitch attractive? 

- Suggestions of possible problems/negatives and explaining how they are not present.

+	What do you want the visitors to learn from your pitch? 

- What the purpose of the sample preparation module is. 

+	What elements have you deliberately put in your presentation to reach your goal?

- Comparison of the sample preparation module to an actual fume hood so you can see the advantages of the sample preparation module.
- Mentioning problems and stating that the sample preparation module is the solution.

### Performance:
+	What is **your** goal of presenting your pitch?

- For people to become interested in the sample preparation module and for them to think of it as a good alternative for the fumehoods.

+	What do you want the visitors to remember after coming to your discussion room?

- That the sample preparation module is cheap, easy to build and widely applicable.
- That you can still do experiments in times of Corona.

+	Which indicators show to you that your visitors are engaged with your message?

- They understand the advantages of the sample preparation module and might consider how it could be applicable in certain situations.


## Evaluation
+ 1.	What worked well about your pitch and presentation?
+ 2.	What did not work as you expected?
+ 3.	Considering your own indicators, how do you evaluate the success of your final presentation?
+ 4.	What feedback have you received from the visitors about the project and about your way of presenting it?
