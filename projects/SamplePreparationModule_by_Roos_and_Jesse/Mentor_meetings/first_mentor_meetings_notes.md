## Review of project goals

+ Review last week’s progress with the project roadmap
Finished all of last weeks agenda point. We didn't really start until this week so there is not much to report.
+ Review global progress and goals
So far we are on schedule and the goals seem to be achieveable.


## Review of project roadmap

+ Agree on and list the deliverables for following meeting
Next week we want to have build the module entirely.
+ Elaborate on adjustment to your time plan or alternative routes

## Meeting feedback (fill after meeting)

+ What did you learn in your mentor meeting? 
We might run into problems that we were not intially expecting, while problems we do expect might not be so bad after all.
+ What decisions have you made based on the discussions?
We are going to see if Dante has wood which we can process in the workshop. Otherwise Jesper will contact Peter to see if he can help us.
We will use tape to make the sides airtight.
Ceramic paint/epoxy should be fine.
+ Any additional comments...
We will contact Jesper as needed and not schedule weekly meetings.
