# Project goals

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball 
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

PROJECT NAME: [sample preparation module](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/Sample_preparation_module)
PROJECT MEMBERS: Roos de Boer and Jesse Buckmann

## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*Fill here what you expect to achieve with the project. Try to make quantitive goals when possible.*

The purpose of our project is to enable users of the off-grid lab to prepare samples that they want to measure. 
To make this possible we build a small fume hood in which samples can be prepared without having to worry about contaminations from the environment. 

goals:
- make it air tight
- spill proof (ceramic coating)
- add ventilation
- provide large enough working area while still fitting the module in the big box


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
So far we are making great progress on obtaining the self-set goals.
The basis for the module is build. We now need to add all the different components, most of which we have already obtained.
1. We have a computer fan which should be strong enough to ventilate the box.
2. We found an polyurethane coating which is, according to the description, strong enough to protect the wood against chemicals. This will be tested after it has been applied. 
3. The work area we have is 50 x 47.6 cm which should be large enough, and it still fits in the off-grid lab. We were pretty suprised by how big that it actually was. After the module had been build we are not sure if working in it is very convenient so we are still thinking about whether we want to make some small design alterations, after doing some preliminary testing in the module we might add a small window at the top through which you can also see what you are doing in the module. This might slightly affect how air tight the module is. 
4. We already realise that making the module completely airtight is nearly impossible, since we also have a ventilation system. If the box were to be completely airtight we would not be able to create a airflow. Therefore we leave some space open at the sliding sash to allow for a proper airflow.

Revised goals:
- Make sides, top and back of module airtight.
- Add ventilation and allow for a proper airflow.
- Workspace is chemically restitant. (polyurethane coating)
- Large enough work space (check)
- Additional window on top of the module for an improved working environment?


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
