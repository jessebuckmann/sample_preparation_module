PROJECT NAME: [sample preparation module](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/Sample_preparation_module)
PROJECT MEMBERS: Roos de Boer and Jesse Buckmann

## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*Fill here what you expect to achieve with the project. Try to make quantitive goals when possible.*

The purpose of our project is to enable users of the off-grid lab to prepare samples that they want to measure. 
To make this possible we build a small fume hood in which samples can be prepared without having to worry about contaminations from the environment. 

goals:
- make it air tight
- spill proof (ceramic coating)
- add ventilation
- provide large enough working area while still fitting the module in the big box


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
So far we are making great progress on obtaining the self-set goals.
The basis for the module is build. We now need to add all the different components, most of which we have already obtained.
1. We have a computer fan which should be strong enough to ventilate the box.
2. We found an polyurethane coating which is, according to the description, strong enough to protect the wood against chemicals. This will be tested after it has been applied. 
3. The work area we have is 50 x 47.6 cm which should be large enough, and it still fits in the off-grid lab. We were pretty suprised by how big that it actually was. After the module had been build we are not sure if working in it is very convenient so we are still thinking about whether we want to make some small design alterations, after doing some preliminary testing in the module we might add a small window at the top through which you can also see what you are doing in the module. This might slightly affect how air tight the module is. 
4. We already realise that making the module completely airtight is nearly impossible, since we also have a ventilation system. If the box were to be completely airtight we would not be able to create a airflow. Therefore we leave some space open at the sliding sash to allow for a proper airflow.

Revised goals:
- Make sides, top and back of module airtight.
- Add ventilation and allow for a proper airflow.
- Workspace is chemically restitant. (polyurethane coating)
- Large enough work space (check)
- Additional window on top of the module for an improved working environment?


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
Now that the project has come to an end it is time to view back on some of the goals we have set for ourselves during the mid-course review.
- We made the sides, top and back of the module airtight
- We added ventilation and tested the airflow.
- Workspace coated with polyurethane managed to resist most of the acids and solvents we used on it. Only the strongest acids caused visible damage which is a pretty good result. We are very pleased with this.
- We also added an additional window on the top to allow for more light in the box and you can now see what your doing in the box when it is placed on a relatively low surface. This was a great improvement in hindsight.

Additionally we also integrated with the temperature group. Their elements are to weak to control the temperature of the entire box so now they are controlling the temperature in our box instead. Since these adjustments were made at the very end and came as a surprise for us. As far as we have seen the progress it looked pretty impressive, eventhough it caused some delay for the integration into the big box. 

We did have to add that not all chemicals will be suitable for use in the box as it damages the coating which means that it is not safe to work with in large quantities. 
Compared to a real fumehood our airflow is also lower, but for the size of our box it is strong enough.
