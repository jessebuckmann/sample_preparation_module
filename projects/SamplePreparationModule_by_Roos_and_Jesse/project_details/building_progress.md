### Sunday 27-09:

We went to the Praxis to buy the wood that is needed for the sample preperation model. 
We bought two 61x120cm pieces of 'multiplex' that has a thickness of 1.2cm.
It was cut for us in 2 pieces of 50x50cm, two pieces of 50x27.6cm and one piece of 50x30cm at Praxis.
We also bought a wooden slat and a plastic rail in which the plexiglass can slide. (insert picture)
Also a piece of pvc pipe with a diameter of 100mm and a retractable pipe with a diameter of 100mm were bought.
At home the pieces of wood were painted on 1 side with a mat white wood paint.
The plastic rail was glued to the wooden slat with construction glue and cut up in 2 pieces of 27.6mm with a hand saw.

### Monday 28-09:

We went to the workshop in the Bleeker building to drill and screw the wood together.
First holes that were the same size as the major diameter of the screw were drilled in one of the boards.
These holes were countersinked on both sides to ensure a tight fit.
In the board that will be attached to the first board, first a approximately 2mm deep hole was drilled with the same size as the screw.
Then a hole with the size of the minor diameter of the screw were drilled as deep as the screw would go.
After drilling all the holes, the boards was screwed together with a normal screwdriver.
We also got a computer fan from Dante which we will have to attach later.

### Thursday 01-10:

We bought a polyurethane coating on wednesday and wanted to coat the workspace with it today. Additionally we decided that we wanted to coat another piece of wood with the polyurethane coating. This extra piece of wood can be used to test the chemical resistance after everything is dry. This is just to keep the module pretty, no other reason. When we arrived at the Minnaert building we found out that Dante had provided us with plexiglass as well. We used kit to install the rail which hold the sliding plexiglass. Unfortunately the plexiglass was just a bit bigger than we had hoped. Making the sliding pretty difficult. We now have a friction fit meaning that we don't need to drill any holes in you rail system. We only had time for one layer of coating today since the polyurethane needs to dry for approximately 2 hours.

### Friday 02-10:

The plan for today was to see if we could get the fan working. After have discussed with the power group we decided it might be best to have a USB male which can be plugged in. We brought an old wire and a powerbank to test if the fan works. After stripping the old wire we attached the Black-> Black and the Red -> Yellow in the 4-pin. Plugging the USB male into the powerbank did indeed make it turn meaning that we now have a working fan, which only needs to be installed. Additionally we also managed to cover the workspace with a second layer of polyurethane.

### Monday 05-10:

We came in with the plan to finish most of the construction work. We made an appointment with Dante to get our final piece of plexiglass, and we made an appointment with Otto to drill some additional holes, in order to attach the plexiglass, and to cut out two holes in the top of the module. The top of the module now has both a window and a ventilation outlet. The reason we added a window in the top of our module is to make the module easier to work with. Since the module is quite deep and not so high it was sometimes inconvenient to work in the module. If the module was on a relatively low working bench you would have to squat while working in it. The addition of the window in the top of the box was a way to circumvent this problem. We also hooked up the fan to a 12V power source and this significantly increased the power of the fan. According to the powergroup this gives no problems for them since they have a 12V battery. We also attached the fan to the inside of the box where it is now suspended from the 'ceiling'. Currently, one of the holders, with which we attached it to the ceiling, prevents the fan from turning so we have to fix this when we are going back to the lab to do experiments.
