###Sunday 27-09:
We went to the Praxis to buy the wood that is needed for the sample preperation model. 
We bought two 61x120cm pieces of 'multiplex' that has a thickness of 1.2cm.
It was cut for us in 2 pieces of 50x50cm, two pieces of 50x27.6cm and one piece of 50x30cm at Praxis.
We also bought a wooden slat and a plastic rail in which the plexiglass can slide. (insert picture)
Also a piece of pvc pipe with a diameter of 100mm and a retractable pipe with a diameter of 100mm were bought.
At home the pieces of wood were painted on 1 side with a mat white wood paint.
The plastic rail was glued to the wooden slat with construction glue and cut up in 2 pieces of 27.6mm with a hand saw.

We went to the workshop in the Bleeker building to drill and screw the wood together.
First holes that were the same size as the major diameter of the screw were drilled in one of the boards.
These holes were countersinked on both sides to ensure a tight fit.
In the board that will be attached to the first board, first a approximately 2mm deep hole was drilled with the same size as the screw.
Then a hole with the size of the minor diameter of the screw were drilled as deep as the screw would go.
After drilling all the holes, the boards was screwed together with a normal screwdriver.
We also got a computer fan from Dante which we will have to attach later.
