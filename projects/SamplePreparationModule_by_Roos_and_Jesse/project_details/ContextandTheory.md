### Context and Theory

The reason for building a sample preparation module in an off-grid lab is relatively straightforward. You want to be able to prepare your samples on site so you can immediately do experiments on them, without having to worry about your sample becoming contaminated by external factors you may encounter on your way to the lab. The sample preparation module should, therefore, be equipped for various kinds of samples. What we will supply is a small fume hood with ventilation and a sliding sash window. We will make sure that fume hood is air tight, meaning that gasses will exit through the ventilation pipe and not through the sides. Additionally the fume hood will be made resistant to small spills of chemicals you might typically use to prepare samples, for instance solvents and diluted acids. This will be done by applying a few coats of polyurethane.

Since we donâ€™t know what kind of experiments will be placed in the off-grid lab at a later stage, we want to make the sample preparation module as general a possible. Contents of the module can be changed depending on the experiment that is placed in the lab. The user should supply the box with the tools that are needed.

The sample preparation module will consist of: ventilation, plexiglass sash windows (4mm) and a spill proof work surface.
The module will be width x depth x height = 50 x 50 x 35 cm. A retractable pipe will be included that can be mounted on the ventilator when in use. It can be demounted to store the module in the off-grid lab. The retractable pipe has a maximum length of 1.5 m which is long enough to keep the user safe from harmful gasses when used outdoor. The pipe can be hung from a window when used indoor. 

### Testing / demonstration:

In order to demonstrate the ventilation system we will use a smoke experiment. We will light several matches in aluminium foil to generate smoke. The matches will be lit by heating the aluminium foil with a lighter. By using smoke we can see whether the ventilation system works and if the sides are airtight. The airtightness of the sides will also be measures with an anemometer, which is a device that measures airflow.

The worksurface will be tested by pouring a small amount of typical solvent and diluted acid over a scrap piece of wood that has been coated with the same polyurethane coating. We know the material is resistant enough when no damage shows upon spilling these chemicals.
