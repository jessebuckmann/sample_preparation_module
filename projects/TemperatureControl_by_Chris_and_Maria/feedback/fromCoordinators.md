I wish there was one. it is a bit dark here despite knowing there is quite some work done!

### on Instructions (timestamp: 12/10/2020 ~15h)
⭐⭐⭐☆☆
Instruction was not included in the ReadMe but the folder "Instructions" gave away where I had to search. Sadly the images in the instruction were not working for me, but nevertheless the explanation seems a bit minimal but complete. It would be nice to know what should happen if everything is connected correctly. There is no step in the instruction to "test" whether the connections have been made properly.
