First of all thank you for your feedback and we will take it into consideration when we update our instructions to be more complete!

- However we have some notes that we would like to share with you in response of some points:

- We indeed had only instructions for Arduino Uno, because our project will be completed with this one. That's because Arduino Due provides us with lower voltage and it is not sufficient for the project to operate. So we will leave that part as it has. However you are right that in the picture we use Arduino Due and that should had been changed but we realized this problem later!

- We do have instructions on how to connect Arduino, but if this is not enough we will try to add more information!

- You are absolutely right about the links of the photos that leads to personal info I have already fixed that problem. But the images were in the same folder as the instructions (you mentioned that they were on a different).

- About the Mosfets they are all the same. The intexes were just to see which Mosfet you will connect with which other. We will make that clear.

- The Peltier is used for both heating and cooling but this is completely explained in [template_Article](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/TemperatureControl_by_Chris_and_Maria/documantation/data/template_Article.pdf) (context and theory)

- The usage of Mosfets is explained also in the previous file and they are necessary if we want to use the same peltier as heater and a cooler.


We will soon update the instructions too, so if you have time you can see them again to tell us if they are more complete! :)
