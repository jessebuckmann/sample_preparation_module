Until now we ended up in the following items that we need:

The temperature controller consists of three main parts:
A.	The cooler system (https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Portable-Mini-Refrigerator/)
1. Thermoelectric Cooler Module ( Banggood )
2. 4 mm Acrylic Sheets ( Amazon )
3. Arduino Nano ( Amazon )
4. Relay Module ( Amazon )
5. LED ( Amazon )
6. LED Holder ( Amazon )
7. 1K Resistor ( Amazon )
8. Rocker Switch ( eBay )
9.DC Jack ( Amazon )
10. Perforated Board ( Amazon )

(We have not decided yet if we are going to use both heating and cooling system)

B.	The control system of the cooler (https://www.electroschematics.com/arduino-fan-speed-controlled-temperature/)

1.	Temperature Sensor LM35?
2.	2 resistor of 1 KΩ each
3.	1 npn bjt transistor BD139
4.	1 diode 1N4007
5.	1 capacitor 100μF/16V

C.	The heating system (https://astronomersanonymous.wordpress.com/2016/04/02/controlling-heating-pads-with-arduino-uno/)

1.	1 Electric Heating Pad (such as: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11289)
2.	1 N-Channel MOSFET (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213 )
3.	1 1N4001 Diode or Schottky Diode ( https://www.adafruit.com/products/755 )
4.	1 10k ohm resistor
5.	1 Arduino Uno or equivalent
6.	Solder & soldering tools
7.	TMP102 digital temperature sensor ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11931 )
8.	Several LEDS (for testing circuit only) and 330 ohm resistors
9.	wire, alligator clips, breadboard
Possible extra wires, batteries of 9V and different power supplies.

About the temperature we are thinking to set the cotroller between 15-30Celsious
