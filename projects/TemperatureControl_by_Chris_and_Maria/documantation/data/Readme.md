Until now we ended up in the following items that we need:

The temperature controller consists of three main parts:
A.	The cooler system (https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Portable-Mini-Refrigerator/)
1. Thermoelectric Cooler Module ( Banggood )
2. 4 mm Acrylic Sheets ( Amazon )
3. Arduino Nano ( Amazon )
4. Relay Module ( Amazon )
5. LED ( Amazon )
6. LED Holder ( Amazon )
7. 1K Resistor ( Amazon )
8. Rocker Switch ( eBay )
9.DC Jack ( Amazon )
10. Perforated Board ( Amazon )

(We have not decided yet if we are going to use both heating and cooling system)

B.	The control system of the cooler (https://www.electroschematics.com/arduino-fan-speed-controlled-temperature/)

1.	Temperature Sensor LM35?
2.	2 resistor of 1 KΩ each
3.	1 npn bjt transistor BD139
4.	1 diode 1N4007
5.	1 capacitor 100μF/16V

C.	The heating system (https://astronomersanonymous.wordpress.com/2016/04/02/controlling-heating-pads-with-arduino-uno/)

1.	1 Electric Heating Pad (such as: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11289)
2.	1 N-Channel MOSFET (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10213 )
3.	1 1N4001 Diode or Schottky Diode ( https://www.adafruit.com/products/755 )
4.	1 10k ohm resistor
5.	1 Arduino Uno or equivalent
6.	Solder & soldering tools
7.	TMP102 digital temperature sensor ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11931 )
8.	Several LEDS (for testing circuit only) and 330 ohm resistors
9.	wire, alligator clips, breadboard
Possible extra wires, batteries of 9V and different power supplies.
