Hello everyone!

We (Chris and Maria) are the team that deals with the temperature control of the box for the actual experiemnt!

Scope of the project:

We aim to measure the temperature and send the value each minute to the software team. Except from that, with the use of peltier we will cool or heat the box when is necessary. More about that you can find in the template_Article inside the file [documantation/data](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/TemperatureControl_by_Chris_and_Maria/documantation/data), where is also the schematic of the circuit and the code we use (so far).

About the instructions:

The instructions on how to reproduce the setup can be found in the file [Instructions](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/TemperatureControl_by_Chris_and_Maria/Instructions) together with some photos that will help you! We will soon add in that file the updated instructions based on our feedback. **Notice**: We are planning to make some more changes on our setup and we have not taken so far accurate measuraments so do not expect to take something. We will inform you through README about the changes we will have! The aim for now is just ro reproduce the setup. 

In the file [feedback](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/tree/master/projects/TemperatureControl_by_Chris_and_Maria/feedback) except from the peer feedback and by the Coordinators you will also find our response!


Here also you can find our canvas as well as our project and personal goals!

If you need further information on something and you believe that it should be here please contact us and we will fix it as soon as possible! :)
