Hello everyone!

We (Chris and Maria) are the team that deals with the temperature control of the box for the actual experiemnt!

We aim to measure the temperature and send the value each minute to the software team. Except from that, with the use of peltier we will cool or heat the box when is necessary. More about that you can find in the template_Article inside the file documantation/data, where is also the schematic of the circuit and the code we use (so far).

Here also you can find our canvas as well as our project and personal goals!

If you need further information on something and you believe that it should be here please contact us and we will fix it as soon as possible! :)
