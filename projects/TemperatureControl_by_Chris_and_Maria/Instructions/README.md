Here you will find the instructions on how to install Arduino in your computer, make the circuit on your own and make it work! If you find something that it is not clear please inform us and we will fix it!

Update: We have uploaded updated instruction BUT they are not completed! This is because we are still working on the project.

Now the circuit is soldered as it was mentioned in peerfeedback, so you will not be able to reproduce it with these materials as you will do this without being soldered!
