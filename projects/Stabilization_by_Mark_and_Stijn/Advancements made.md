21-9-20:

We solded(partially had sold) our accelerometer to a breadboard, so that we could connect it to a Arduino.

We then had a meeting with our Mentor (see Mentor_Notes.md)

We connected our Arduino Due to our accelerometer. However, we weren't able to generate any output. We found out that Arduino Due and our accelerometer are not compatible. Because of this, we have asked Dante if we could get a Arduino Uno from him. If it can be found, we will be able to get this from him tomorrow (22-9-20), so that we can see if our accelerometer works.

We were also able to gain the measurements from the InnerBox 
InnerBox - Width: 30, Length: 50, Hight: 35 
OuterBox - Width: , Length: , Hight:
