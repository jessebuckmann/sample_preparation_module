In this folder, you can find the rad data signals from the oscilloscoop. 

The names coincide with how the setup looked. For example, this means that we only used foam beneath the board, and no substance between the board and mass for "AmlitudeFoam". For the "AmplitudeFoamSpring", there was also foam beneath the board, but now there were also springs between the board and the mass.
