In this ReadMe-file, we will place the manual for our folders, as well as our experiments. 

The purpose of our experiment was to be able to both see/filter out vibrations, as well as get/keep the experiment level.

**Vibrations:**
The main experiment that the "experiment-group" wanted to do, was the Cavendish-Experiment. This means that frequenties below 10 Hz will be "deadly" to the experiment. Our main objective thus became a little more specific than what we started with. However, we weren't to find a good way to "create" these low frequenties, in order to measure them and thus see if our system could filter them out. Because of this, we have only taken a look at frequenties between 20 and 100 Hz, because those we could create and thus see. 

In a vibration experiment, one needs 3 things:
- Something that creates the vibrations
- A mass that vibrates, on which you can stick your measuring device
- A device on which you can see the data measured.

In our case, that something that creates vibrations became a bass-speaker. This bass-speaker has been secured to a woaden board, which we put on some form of dampening substance. This way, the board will start to vibrate. On the other end of the board, we can then put our mass with our measuring device (the acceleromotor). Between the board and the mass, we can then prepare our system (this can be springs, a dampening substance, or in the easiest case: nothing). To see what has been measured, one has to take a look at what kind of acceleromotor one has. For our experiment, we used an acceleromotor that could directly be plugged into an oscilloscope, meaning that we could visualize the waves over there. However, one can also use the computer and the waveforms-programme of digilent, which is also able to visualize waves. The only thing that's left now, is to show how the system that you have taken a look at reacts to a certain frequency. This is done by making a bode plot.
