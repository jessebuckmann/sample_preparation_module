Week 21-27: Hopefully be able to solder the accelerometer to an breadboard, as well as be able to connect it to the arduino. We will also be trying to get the arduino to send data to our computer. If we can also see/read this data, that would be perfect as well. 
    
    Mentor meeting with Rinske (21-9-2020// 16:00)

Week 28-04: Start measuring the vibrations of different systems. We do this by making different bodeplots (and writing code). We will also ask Ravi how we go from the arduino to them. 

The different setups that we are going to test are:
- Only springs under
- Spring under, external demper (rubber spring)
- Spring under, oil bath with plunger
- Spring under, foam under
- Spring under, rasta to the side
- Any other combination

Week 05-11: Start building the box itself, as well as the leveling-system. Another possibility is letting someone else make the box.... ?!
