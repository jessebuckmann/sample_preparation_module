In the beginning, we had set the bar quite high. A big problem for us, is the fact that it's very hard to actually measure low frequencies. The reason that this is a problem, is because, for the Cavendisch experiment, low frequencies are quite deadly and will disturb the measurement a lot. Because of this, we intended on building a double-spring system, which would be able to both filter out high and low frequencies. From theory, we know that such a system would work for our specific needs. 

In the end, we weren't able to build this system, because we were weren't even able to create these low frequencies in a good way. However, we were able to "build" a system that was already quite good at filtering out frequencies, which ended up being a simpler form of a double-spring system (or in our case, a damper/spring-spring system).
