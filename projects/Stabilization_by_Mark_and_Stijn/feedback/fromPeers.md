## Report 

### Documentation:

1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment?

*Their purpose is to detect and filter out vibrations, as well as levelling a bed. This is a clearly defined objective and we see how this could be useful for some experiments in the modular experiment box.*

2.	Were the safety instructions clear?

*Not being drunk in the lab seems like good advice, could be phrased differently though. Otherwise, all hazerds seem to be adressed.*

3.	How helpful is the documentation for reproducing the measurement?

*Not very helpful. The mention what they measured but not how.*

4.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
5.	Are you guided to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?
6.	What can be improved in the documentation?

### Measurements:

1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?
3.	Can you understand and explain the analysis procedure to a third person?
4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those without contacting the owners?
6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?

### Interactions:

1.	Could you relate to the stated goal of the project?
2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?
3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?
4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?
