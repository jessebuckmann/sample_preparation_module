*Personal goals*

- From the course I expect to learn more about how to start and organize a project where many people are working together. This includes the (hopefully) well structured communication within our sub-group, as well as the information exchange with the whole course.
- For the subproject I expect to learn way more about electronics, data transfer and how to connect diffrent sub-systems with each other.
- I also hope to learn some dutch - teach me guys!
