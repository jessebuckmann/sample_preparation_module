## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*Fill here what you expect to achieve with the project. Try to make quantitive goals when possible.*
The purpose of our project is to enable users of the off-grid lab to prepare samples that they want to measure. To make this possible we build a small fume hood in which samples can be prepared without having to worry about contaminations from the environment. In order to make a good fume hood we need to meet some general specifications. The hood needs to be ventilated so that any (harmful) fumes produced in the preparation of the sample are not inhaled by the users. The hood itself also needs to be protected against whatever substances are inside the hood. We aim to do this by using a ceramic coating, this should be resistant to most of the substances that are in the hood. Finally to avoid any contaminations we aim to make the box mostly air tight so that materials such as dust and sand don't get in the box.  

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note your progress and re-adjust your goals such that you can deliver at the end*


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
