*Utrecht Experiment Design 2020*

# Project goals

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball 
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

PROJECT NAME: Cavendish Torsion Balance   
PROJECT MEMBERS: Geert Schulpen, Jillis Schokking  

## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*We want to prove it is possible to do a reasonably complex measurement in the modular box*  
*We want to measure Newton's gravitational constant (big G)*  
### Subgoals
*Understand how sensitive our setup is to vibrations such that we can give an estimate for the maximal allowable vibration amplitudes to the vibration team*  
*Find a way to modify an excisting experiment setup to make it work within the confines and limitations of the modular experimental system*  
*Find a way to automate the experiment*

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
It might not be possible to carry out the experiment in the box due to the limitations of the vibration control team.  
The setup is modified to fit in the box.  
The automation of the experiment still has to take place, but we are confident this is going to work


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
