*Utrecht Experiment Design 2020*

# Project goals

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to define your targets for the project you have chosen and to keep your eyes on the ball 
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of checks and measure for evaluation of your project
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

PROJECT NAME: Cavendish Torsion Balance
PROJECT MEMBERS: Geert Schulpen, Jillis Schokking

## Project goals (fill this at the start of the course)
*We want to prove it is possible to do a reasonably complex measurement in the modular box*
*We want to measure Newton's gravitational constant (big G)*
### Subgoals
*Understand how sensitive our setup is to vibrations such that we can give an estimate for the maximal allowable vibration amplitudes to the vibration team*
*Copy the setup of the experiment to make it fit in the space we will get*


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note your progress and re-adjust your goals such that you can deliver at the end*


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
*Evaluate the project performance according to your mid-course goals. State what changes are necessary and which goals had to be adjusted.*
