# Cavendish Torsion Balance

Welcome to the folder which contains all the information on the Cavendish Torsion Balance project.  

The project is run by Jillis Schokking (j.b.e.schokking@students.uu.nl) and Geert Schulpen (g.h.a.schulpen@students.uu.nl).
You can reach us by [MS teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a17671f7d35194c9aa6a368c449fd96fe%40thread.tacv2/grand%2520project?groupId=b36d7aae-63c5-44c9-a860-073e4ffd37ae&tenantId=d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7) or in person if we by chance are around. 

## Description of the project
We try to measure the gravitational constant G by way of the classic experiment, which was first done by [Henry Cavendish](https://www.jstor.org/stable/106988). 
The experiment has been redesigned based a setup which is used in a first year course due to the size constraints of the box. 


## Current state of the project
The final setup is almost finished. 
A short overview of the context and theory for the experiment can be found [here](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/CavendishTorsionBalance_by_Geert_and_Jillis/ContextAndTheory.md). 
A short instruction manual for working with the setup can be found [here](https://git.science.uu.nl/g.h.a.schulpen/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/CavendishTorsionBalance_by_Geert_and_Jillis/instructionManual.md).  



## Roadmap  
The last few elements are in the process of being finalized to finish the setup. 
Meanwhile a instruction manual is being made and a testrun of the experiment will be performed during this week (probably on 07-10-2020).
