# Cavendish Torsion Balance

Welcome to the folder which contains all the information on the Cavendish Torsion Balance project.  

The project is run by Jillis Schokking (j.b.e.schokking@students.uu.nl) and Geert Schulpen (g.h.a.schulpen@students.uu.nl).
You can reach us by [MS teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a17671f7d35194c9aa6a368c449fd96fe%40thread.tacv2/grand%2520project?groupId=b36d7aae-63c5-44c9-a860-073e4ffd37ae&tenantId=d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7) or in person if we by chance are around. 

## Description of the project
We try to measure the gravitational constant G by way of a torsion balance, which was first done by [Henry Cavendish](https://www.jstor.org/stable/106988). The current setup is a redesign of the basic setup as used by first year students. This was necessary due to the size constraints of the modular experiment box. The experiment setup is almost finished, and can be used in its current state to measure the gravitational constant. A short overview of the context and theory for the experiment can be found [here](ContextAndTheory.md). An instruction manual for working with the setup can be found [here](instructionManual.md). Proper measurements will require carefull calibration. 


## Current state of the project (roadmap)
At present, our setup should be able to measure the gravitational constant. Electronic elements are plug and play. Only the installation of WaveForms is required. In its current state we have completed the following items:
- Found a temporary bed with enough vibrational damping.
- Moddeled and 3d printed all necessary structural parts
- Implemented a way to measure angles (Digital Discovery 2, Laser, Sensor and Modulator)
- Automatic rotation of the outer ring (Arduino, belts, servo's)
- Construction of the halter.

The following items still need to be finalized:
- Construction of a proper bed that fits in the modular experiment box.
- An automatic release mechanism for the torsion balance.
