# Cavendish Torsion Balance

This folder will contain all the information on the Cavendish Torsion Balance project.  

The project is run by Jillis Schokking (j.b.e.schokking@students.uu.nl) and Geert Schulpen (g.h.a.schulpen@students.uu.nl).  

## Current state of the project
The final setup is almost finished.
A short overview of the context and theory for the experiment can be found [here](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/CavendishTorsionBalance_by_Geert_and_Jillis/ContextAndTheory.md). 
A short instruction manual for working with the setup can be found [here](https://git.science.uu.nl/g.h.a.schulpen/experiment-design-2020/-/blob/master/projects/CavendishTorsionBalance_by_Geert_and_Jillis/instructionManual.md)
In the file planning and subgoals a short term planning can be found. 
This file will be updated when new short term goals are needed.  


## Roadmap  
The last few elements are in the process of being finalized to finish the setup. 
Meanwhile a instruction manual is being made and a testrun of the experiment will be performed during this week (probably on 07-10-2020).
