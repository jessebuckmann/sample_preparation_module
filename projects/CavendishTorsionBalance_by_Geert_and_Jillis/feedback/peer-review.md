## Report 

### Documentation:

1.	Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? 
Yes meassure g constant.
2.	Were the safety instructions clear?
Yes
3.	How helpful is the documentation for reproducing the measurement?
/10. Some parts were a little complicated. The software mostly. Also dont say how to interpret data.
4.	Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
Yes downloading and installing waveforms
5.	Are you guided to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?
No, there was nothing about the meassurments, but apart from that, documentation was very structured.
6.	What can be improved in the documentation?
Make do not touch sign more apparent. Include data analysis work flow.


### Measurements:

1.	Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
Yes we can.
2.	How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?
There were no previously reported results.
3.	Can you understand and explain the analysis procedure to a third person?
The theory yes, the actual numerical analysis no.
4.	Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
No not at all.
5.	Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those without contacting the owners?
Yes/yes.
6.	What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?
The physics of course.

### Interactions:

1.	Could you relate to the stated goal of the project?
Yes.
2.	Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?
None
3.	Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?
We can not say for sure.
4.	What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?
More robust setup(longer cables so you dont have to get close to torsion). How to transfer the whole system outside. Clearer instructions on data analysis.
