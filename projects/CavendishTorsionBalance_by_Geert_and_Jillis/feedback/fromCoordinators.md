Team Geert, Jillis

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ readme can improve, I see planning has more deliberate placeholders -> or turn it into an index
+ how to make it exciting for others?
+ ellaborate on and justify the interconnections with the rest of the project
+ is mentor meeting done? when was the date? 

### Conversation on the progress status

+ use the exixting communications tools for documenting the exchanges with the other groups
+ focus on the process more than the mechanics

⭐⭐☆☆☆
good that contributors are clear and elements are identified.
dissapoiting a bit for the reader who want so engage, as if she is not welcome to read further!
what about your goals? are you excited at all about what you're doing. These are the question I asked myself when opening your folder and was left with no answer.  

### on Instructions (timestamp: 12/10/2020 ~15h)
⭐⭐⭐☆☆
Instructions are easy to find and very concise. I think the values for weights etc. of the torsion balance should be part of the measuring steps and not given outright as people trying to reproduce might not use the same setup. Aside from that, the instructions provide the minimal steps needed to reproduce the experiment.
