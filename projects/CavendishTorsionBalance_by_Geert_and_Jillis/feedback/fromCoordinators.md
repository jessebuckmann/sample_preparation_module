# Week 4 discussion

Team Geert, Jillis

### Feedback on canvas and goals

+ readme can improve, I see planning has more deliberate placeholders -> or turn it into an index
+ how to make it exciting for others?
+ ellaborate on and justify the interconnections with the rest of the project
+ is mentor meeting done? when was the date? 

### Conversation on the progress status

+ use the exixting communications tools for documenting the exchanges with the other groups
+ focus on the process more than the mechanics
