# Context for the Cavendish balance

In 1680 Isaac Newton published his law for the gravitational force  $`F_g =G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}`$.
The proportionality constant was determined about a century later by Henry Cavendish in a experiment involving a torsion balance and two big masses.
The frequency of the balance yields a value for the torsional spring constant,
such that from the equilibrium position the force between the big masses and the torsion balance can be found.
Current determinations of the gravitational constant use a similar technique, where a torsion balance is influenced by big masses nearby.

# Theory
The torsion balance experiences two torques when it is in equilibrium at an angle $`\phi_0`$,
compared to the equilibrium position without the massive balls nearby.
One is based on the gravitational force ($`\tau_g =F_g L \sin\alpha`$), the other is based on the torsion in the wire  ($`\tau_t = -D \phi`$).
However, the balance does not start out in equilibrium and thus will oscilate around $`\phi_0`$.
The rotational equivalent of Newton's second law yields 
```math
I \frac{d^2\phi}{d t^2} = \sum\tau = -D(\phi-\phi_0) - B\frac{d\phi}{dt},
```
here $`B`$ is the damping coefficient for the torsion balance. 
Such that the solution is a damped oscilation
```math
\phi(t) = A \exp{\left(-\frac{B}{2I}t\right)}\ \sin\left(\sqrt{\omega_0^2-\left(\frac{B}{2I}\right)^2}\right) + \phi_0.
```
Where $`\omega_0 =\sqrt{D/I}`$ is the natural frequency of the balance.
