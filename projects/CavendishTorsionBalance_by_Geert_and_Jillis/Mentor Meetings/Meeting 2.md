# Weekly mentor meeting

### POP

+ **Purpose**: To review your progress and to keep your project on track.
+ **Outcome(s)**: You know how to proceed with your project.
+ **Process**: Discuss problems → Get feedback → Review goals → Make new weekly plan

Week no.: 4, 22-09-2020
PROJECT NAME: Cavendish Balance


## Review of project roadmap

+ Suggestion active torsion balance seems unattainable given the timescale of the project  
+ Rough estimation of vibrations; measurement is vulnerable to vibrations < 10 Hz, not to vibrations of higher frequecy
+ Natural frequency of torsion balance is 1 Hz, so setup needs suppres vibrations of 0.1 Hz and higher.  


## Meeting feedback (fill after meeting)

+ TODO better vibration estimation?
+ Ask vibration control for high pass filter (inverted pendulum?)
+ Think about modulation system for LASER and sensor; does this need 240V, or can the transformer be taken out?
