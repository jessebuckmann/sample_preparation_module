## Review of project roadmap

+ Agree on and list the deliverables for following meeting
+ Elaborate on adjustment to your time plan or alternative routes

## Meeting feedback (fill after meeting)

+ What did you learn in your mentor meeting? 

Power goal is too ambitious. So we will look for smaller/lower options.

Decide quickly on values for key metrics.

+ What decisions have you made based on the discussions?
Look into the following components:

small systems:
+ lithium ion circuit boards.
+ USB 5v to test maybe.

Battery:
+ battery control units.
+ output stabilize (battery shields).
+ charging circuit for larger batteries.

DC/DC converters for voltage control
+ Buck converter, or one of many other options.

Separate loads on the output
+ Voltage divider to set different output voltages. All loads in parallel, with fuse for each.


+ Any additional comments...
