## From the course coordinator
 
I am thrilled to be your host in the second round of the Utrecht Experiment Design (UED) course. My name is Sanli and I want to make this course the most memorable one in your program.

The main goal of this course is to empower you (plural) to be a distinguishable cohort of experimental physics students.  Last year, the first cohort of UED students co-created this course with us and the mentors and experts at the physics department. The course ended with a festive poster presentation. We even had cake and everyone was very pleased. Some of those students will be your mentors this year. 

This year, we are equipped with the experience and feedback of your predecessors and have planned a tighter framework. The major part of the course, however, will be filled in with your participation. 

I hope that this guide can help you navigate through the logistics and instructions of this round. If anything is unclear or if you have questions that are not answered, please reach out to me directly. I am here to help.
