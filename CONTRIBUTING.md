# Experiment Design 2020

Thank you for your participation in the Utrecht Experiment Design course. If you have come this far, you are either a student, a mentor, or and expert willing to help. This document guides you through the UED2020 repositoy. In theory, this repository must include all the information you need to contributed effectively to the course. 

Everyone taking part in Experiment Design course and discussions (mentors, helpers, coordinators, and learners) is required to conform to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read the code carefully. Coordinators will oversee adherence to this code throughout the course.


## As students 

As in most open projects, there is no best way of contributing to the Experiment Design course. As a student, participating in the course for the first time, however, following [the syllabus](Syllabus_2020.md) is perhaps the most straightforward path. 

We try to make this repository and its documentation self-contained and instructive. You are therefore highly encouraged to use UED2020 repo from the start for you documentation. Here is a list of recommendations:

+ Fork this repository into your gitlab account, and make the coordinators and other contributors a member of your project.
+ Create a personal progress checklist from [this template](./Coordination/_Templates/progress_checklist.md) on the [UED2020 issues](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/issues). **Timestamps on this issue will be used as the basis for grading.**
+ After choosing a project, create a subfolder (convention: ProjectName_TeamMembers) in your repo. Keep all you notes and project documentation in this subfolder. 
+ Deliver your assignments by sending pull-requests to the UED2020 repo.
+ Use you presonal issue for Q&A with the course coordinator about your project.
+ Use [MS Teams group channels](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a873e11d0442d4ccba0f542092004b1e0%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=eea5ff66-ce0f-476e-8755-535cdaced1f7&tenantId=d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7) for rapid messaging with and seeking assistance from other participants.
+ Use MS Teams direct chat for communication with the coordinators and discussing personal goals and all things non-public.

## As mentors

Mentors' main role is to help the project teams define their path to achiving their project goals. On this path they are guides, rather than supervisors, as the full responsibility of the project lies with the students. Please have a look at the [roles and responsibilities](./Coordination/Roles_and_Responsibilities.md) of the various actors.

It is expected from mentors to:  
+ Regularly observe the progress of the project (30 minutes/week)
+ Provide advice on project steps or suggest an expert or reading materials
+ Provide feedback to the mentee to consider
+ Provide feedback to the course coordinator at the end of the course 

Mentors are more than welcome to suggest changes to the [course syllabus](Syllabus_2020.md) or to contribute to any other part of this repository by committing to changes or posting [issues](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2020/experiment-design-2020/-/issues). 

**DO NOT change any text above this line without consulting the course coordinators.**
