During this course, students select and design an experimental project starting from the drawing board. By following the course students can learn how to use Python to interface electronic apparatus for computer-controlled measurements.   
They also learn about principles of open-science and the best practices for collecting, managing, and interpreting experimental data. Each project team is guided by a scientific mentor and assisted by several experts and technicians in the department. Through peer-feedback and regular cohort discussions, the students help each other to improve the presentation of their projects and to check the reproducibility of their results and adequacy of their documentation in a cooperative way. 

By means of guest lectures, students are also introduced to the experimental breakthroughs of the past few decades and the scientific discoveries that has made these breakthroughs possible. Examples, covered in the past, are development of scanning probe techniques, electron microscopy, and laser spectroscopy. 

These qualifications trained and tested in this course are necessary for a distinguished "master" of Experimental Physics. The central goal behind theis course, however, is **to empower our students to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges**. For this purpose, a major part of the training focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, accountable communications, and principles of working in open teams.
