# Experiment Design 2020

Mentors and experts help the students to learn the skills they lack or to find their ways in the department and workshops. Each team of students will be assigned a mentor at the beginning of the course. Experts are ready to help any of the students with their technical questions per request (if you ask kindly).

## List of other required expertise
+ add to the list


## Expectations for a mentor-student relationship:

+ Students are responsible for:  
    + Organising the mentor and expert meetings. 
    + Reporting on their progress to the mentor and the course coordinators. 

+ Mentors:  
    + Regularly monitor the progress of the project (8 sessions, 30 minutes each). 
    + Provide advice on project steps or suggest an expert or reading materials when needed. 
    + Provide feedback to the students to consider. 
    + Provide feedback to the course coordinator at the end of the course.

## Recommended to mentors

### Do

+ Create a comfortable environment that allows individuals to share ideas openly. 
+ Understand that feedback and learning goes both ways. 
+ Allow students to embrace their mistakes as learning experiences. 
+ Be patient with students; don’t expect them to understand a new concept the first time. 
+ Be connected. Let students reach you when they have questions. 
+ Help students make a connection between what they are learning and how it is used in the real-world.  
+ Set expectations of each party - know collective goals. 
+ Face-to-face interaction helps, but when possible students can be supported via electronic communication

### Don’t

+ Don’t try to lead the project for students. Instead, share your experience and help in getting to the answers.  
+ Don’t Assume that something is too hard for the students to accomplish. Try to give them your estimate of the difficulty or requirements.
