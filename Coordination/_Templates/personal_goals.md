## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
During this course, I expect to strengthen my ability to work in a team, but still have my own responsibilities. I think this course will teach me things that are usefull in doing research, but are not taught in the standard physics related curriculum, like working with electrical circuits, using microcontrollers and even doing some construction tasks. I hope we can finish the project and have a nice and operational off-grid lab at the end. 

Personal goals:
*  learn to work with microcontrollers/electrical circuits
*  making all deadlines
*  embrace working in a team
*  clearly write everything down while I'm doing it (not the day after)
*  not forcing my ideas

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.*


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
