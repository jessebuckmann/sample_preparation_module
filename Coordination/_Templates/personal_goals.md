## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
I am still not quite sure what to expect from this course. I hope that we can find a nice project that everyone will enjoy.
Hopefully we manage to build something that works. In this project we will see the importance of properly denoting what you do, so the results are reproducable. 
I have never had to do an experiment written by someone else in the group or recieved feedback on my own experiment notes from other students, so I think that this will be an interesting opportunity.
Since everything is done in groups I hope to be able to communicate with the people in my group properply. Considering we want to build something I think it is also important to communicate with the other groups regularly.
By communication your findings the other groups can also build on this which would lead to a better final result. 
I would also really like to use some of the theory provided in one of the lectures in our project, this would make for a nice challenge, since it forces me to work with something I have not used before.
