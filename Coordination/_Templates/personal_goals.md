STUDENT NAME:

## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
I am still not quite sure what to expect from this course. I hope that we can find a nice project that everyone will enjoy.
Hopefully we manage to build something that works. In this project we will see the importance of properly denoting what you do, so the results are reproducable. 
I have never had to do an experiment written by someone else in the group or recieved feedback on my own experiment notes from other students, so I think that this will be an interesting opportunity.


## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.*


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
