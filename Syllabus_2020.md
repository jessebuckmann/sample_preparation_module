# Experiment Design Syllabus 2020

The _official_ learning outcomes, as listed on the course catalogue, are:

1. After the course, the student is able to acquaint her/himself with the application of an experimental technique and can quantitatively argue the suitability of this technique to a given physical problem.  
2. After the course, the student has a basic knowledge of data analysis/presentation techniques relevant to a given field of research. The student can implement these techniques using a programming language and libraries relevant to that field.  
3. After the course, the student knows how to collect, manage and interpret data in types/formats relevant to their specific field of research.  
4. After the course, the student can discuss, describe and interpret data, both verbally and in the form of a short report.  
5. After the course, students can collaborate in a team to design and carry out a short experimental project.  

These capabilities are noble and necessary for a distinguished *master* of Experimental Physics. The central goal behind these outcomes, however, is to **empower you to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges**. For this purpose, a major part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams. 

To get closer to achieving this central goal in, next to technical discussions, exercises, and seminars, you will also
+ Learn the principles and vocabularies of:  
	+ Openness  
	+ Open Leadership  
	+ Community interactions  
	+ Value exchanges  
	+ Engagement  
	+ Diversity  
	+ Inclusion  
	+ Accessibility  
	+ Safety  
	+ Culture change  
+ Learn how to apply those principles to open leadership and working open in your groups.  
+ Learn how to collect, invite, and tell stories that demonstrate how solving the chosen problems benefits the communities you belong to.  

## This Syllabus

This syllabus is a "living" document. The course coordinators are open to suggestions regarding changes to this document or the workflow. Bring this up in a cohort meeting, bring it up on Teams, or contact a course coordinator

## Schedule
Due to pandemic restrictions, in-person gatherings for UED2020 are only held on Mondays. The online cohort meetings will be on Thursdays. Meetings with experts and mentors can be arranged also on other days. The study/work-load is expected to be about 20 hours per week.

This schedule is set based on the coordinators' experience with execution of an experimental project and the feedback from the students of last year. There is no unique path to achieving the course goals and __we will adjust the schedule as necessary during our cohort meetings__.

---

## Week 1 (Thursday 03-09-2020) - Introduction

During this week, we will have only one online meeting on Thursday at 9:30 - 12:00. All participants will introduce themselves and the coordinators will discuss the goals of the course with you, and explain the suggested path to successfully achieve the learning outcomes. The structure of the working hours and cohort meetings will be presented. Also the required means of communication will be presented and tested.

We will also have one online lecture in the second hour.

## Week 5 (28-09-2020) - Understanding Noise

During this week, you write the necessary code for analysing your measured data and recovering the errors in an efficient way. Try to test your analysis methods on benchmark measurements and identify the sources of noise and error in your experiment.

Make a plan, together with your mentor, for fixing the glitches in the measurement setup, your understanding of your experiment and the physics of it. Execute the plan and explain what you have learned so far to your peers.

During this week, each team will meet with the course coordinators to discuss their progress.
 
### Cohort meeting

#### Before the cohort meeting:

+ Make a first-signal milestone celebration art-piece
+ discuss your revised project goals with your mentor and the course coordinator
+ Identify sources of noise and error in your experiment and write a summary

#### After the cohort meeting:

+ Update your personal goals (under mid-course review)
+ Write a report (maximum 500 words excluding figures and equations) on the context and theory of your experiment. This report is due before the Monday class on Week 6 (05-10-2020). Comment under your progress issue that your report is ready and @ Sanli and Jasper.

## Week 6 (05-10-2020) - Writing Instructions:

During this week, you will beta-test and your project and make it safe to use, as much as possible. You will write a users' instructions for the setup, how to reproduce your results, and how to progress further from where you are with this project.

You will explain your project to another group before the cohort meeting. During the meeting, that group will then have to explain your project to the rest of the cohort.

### Deadlines
Before the start of this Monday's meeting, you have to met your deadlines up to the point "committed report on context and theory". (Please update your issues!)

#### Before the cohort meeting:

---

## Week 7 (12-10-2020)- Reproducibility

During this week, you will share your setup, work instructions, and results with your peers and ask them to reproduce your results. You will do the same for some other project and report on the reproducibility of those results and the qualities of the work instructions.

### Deadlines
Before the start of this Monday's meeting, you have to met your deadlines up to the point "committed instructions and pull request to the UED2020". (Please update your issues!)

#### Before the cohort meeting:

Fill in the [reproducibility feedback](./Coordination/_Templates/reproducibility_review) for the project assigned to you and discuss it with the group owner.

#### After the cohort meeting:

## Week 8 (19-10-2020) - Reflections and Revisions:

During this week, you will implement the feedback you have received from your mentor and other cohort members and start working on the poster for presenting your results. Discuss you poster design with your mentor.

During the cohort meeting on Monday, you will hear a presentation about story-telling and its important for presenting your results.

In week 8 you will make the poster for presenting your experiment on Thursday, November 7th.
