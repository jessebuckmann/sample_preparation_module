# Experiment Design Syllabus 2020

The _official_ learning outcomes, as listed on the course catalogue, are:

1. After the course, the student is able to acquaint her/himself with the application of an experimental technique and can quantitatively argue the suitability of this technique to a given physical problem.  
2. After the course, the student has a basic knowledge of data analysis/presentation techniques relevant to a given field of research. The student can implement these techniques using a programming language and libraries relevant to that field.  
3. After the course, the student knows how to collect, manage and interpret data in types/formats relevant to their specific field of research.  
4. After the course, the student can discuss, describe and interpret data, both verbally and in the form of a short report.  
5. After the course, students can collaborate in a team to design and carry out a short experimental project.  

The central goal behind these outcomes, however, is to __empower you to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges__. For this purpose, a major part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams. 

To get closer to achieving this central goal in, next to technical discussions, exercises, and seminars, you will also
+ Learn the principles and vocabularies of:  
	+ Openness.  
	+ Open Leadership.  
	+ Community interactions.  
	+ Value exchanges.  
	+ Engagement.  
	+ Diversity.  
	+ Inclusion.  
	+ Accessibility.  
	+ Safety.  
	+ Culture change.  
+ Learn how to apply those principles to open leadership and working open in your groups.  
+ Learn how to collect, invite, and tell stories that demonstrate how solving the chosen problems benefits the communities you belong to.  


## Schedule
The Utrecht Experiment design course is run for the second time this year. This schedule is set based on the coordinators' experience with execution of an experimental project and the feedback from the students of last year. There is no unique path to achieving these goals and we will adjust the schedule as necessary during our cohort meetings. 


### Week 1 (09-09-19)

__Week 1 - Introduction:__

During this week, the coordinators will discuss the goals of the course with you, and explain the suggested path to successfully achieve the learning outcomes. The structure of the working hours and cohort meetings will be presented.   

You will also form teams and choose a project and express your preference for a mentor that will give you feedback on your progress with the project and connect you to experts when needed. There are no mentor meetings planned this week. When a mentor has accepted this role for your project, you will be informed by the coordinator. You should then reach out to your mentor to confirm when and where you'll be meeting.

In this week guest lectures, 
+ we will hear about the advent of scanning probe methods by Dr. Ingmar Swart (Monday, 14:00-15:00).
    - it will be useful to read the [Gerd Binnig Nobel lecture](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1986/binnig/lecture/)
    - [Ingmar's lecture slides](https://solisservices-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/s_faez_uu_nl/Documents/ExperimentDesignCourse/students/Slides/Scanning%20probe%20methods.pptx?d=w69d54ee3c3ee43b0bfd638ea96b4cab7&csf=1&e=PMSHks)


During this week cohort meeting we will discuss
+ The course goals and the schedule. 
+ 2-min introduction of all students and their interests (think of this before the meeting)
+ Value exchanges, community interactions in project groups
+ Decide collectively on our [code of conduct](https://solisservices-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/s_faez_uu_nl/Documents/ExperimentDesignCourse/students/Code%20of%20Conduct%20(protected).docx?d=wc0f2da2481074d8f965b8723f000061d&csf=1&e=wZvdTa)

On the thursday extra cohort meeting we will discuss
+ principles for choosing a research topic and discuss the [speech of George Whitesides](https://vimeo.com/96076471)
+ history and current state of the [Safecast](https://blog.safecast.org/about/)
+ formation of the teams for the experiments
+ we will see a demonstration of a lens-less computational imaging setup.

### Week 5 (07-10-19)

__Week 5 - Understanding Noise and Troubleshooting:__

During this week, you write the necessary code for analysing your measured data and recovering the errors in an efficient way. Try to test your analysis methods on benchmark measurements and identify the sources of noise and error in your experiment.

Make a plan, together with your mentor, for fixing the glitches in the measurement setup, your understanding of your experiment and the physics of it. Execute the plan and explain what you have learned so far to your peers.

During this week, each team will meet with the course coordinators to discuss their progress.
 

__Resources:__

__Week 6 - Writing Instructions:__

During this week, you will beta-test and your project and make it safe to use, as much as possible. You will write a users' instructions for the setup, how to reproduce your results, and how to progress further from where you are with this project.

You will explain your project to another group before the cohort meeting. During the meeting, that group will then have to explain your project to the rest of the cohort.

__Resources:__

__Before the cohort meeting:__
