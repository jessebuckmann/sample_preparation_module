# Experiment Design Syllabus 2020

The _official_ learning outcomes, as listed on the course catalogue, are:

1. After the course, the student is able to acquaint her/himself with the application of an experimental technique and can quantitatively argue the suitability of this technique to a given physical problem.  
2. After the course, the student has a basic knowledge of data analysis/presentation techniques relevant to a given field of research. The student can implement these techniques using a programming language and libraries relevant to that field.  
3. After the course, the student knows how to collect, manage and interpret data in types/formats relevant to their specific field of research.  
4. After the course, the student can discuss, describe and interpret data, both verbally and in the form of a short report.  
5. After the course, students can collaborate in a team to design and carry out a short experimental project.  

These capabilities are noble and necessary for a distinguished *master* of Experimental Physics. The central goal behind these outcomes, however, is to **empower you to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges**. For this purpose, a major part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams. 

To get closer to achieving this central goal in, next to technical discussions, exercises, and seminars, you will also
+ Learn the principles and vocabularies of:  
	+ Openness  
	+ Open Leadership  
	+ Community interactions  
	+ Value exchanges  
	+ Engagement  
	+ Diversity  
	+ Inclusion  
	+ Accessibility  
	+ Safety  
	+ Culture change  
+ Learn how to apply those principles to open leadership and working open in your groups.  
+ Learn how to collect, invite, and tell stories that demonstrate how solving the chosen problems benefits the communities you belong to.  

## This Syllabus

This syllabus is a "living" document. The course coordinators are open to suggestions regarding changes to this document or the workflow. Bring this up in a cohort meeting, bring it up on Teams, or contact a course coordinator

## Schedule
Due to pandemic restrictions, in-person gatherings for UED2020 are only held on Mondays. The online cohort meetings will be on Thursdays. Meetings with experts and mentors can be arranged also on other days. The study/work-load is expected to be about 20 hours per week.

This schedule is set based on the coordinators' experience with execution of an experimental project and the feedback from the students of last year. There is no unique path to achieving the course goals and __we will adjust the schedule as necessary during our cohort meetings__.

---

## Week 1 (Thursday 03-09-2020) - Introduction

During this week, we will have only one online meeting on Thursday at 9:30 - 12:00. All participants will introduce themselves and the coordinators will discuss the goals of the course with you, and explain the suggested path to successfully achieve the learning outcomes. The structure of the working hours and cohort meetings will be presented. Also the required means of communication will be presented and tested.

We will also have one online lecture in the second hour.

## Week 2 (07-09-2020) - Course and Project goals

You will also form teams, choose a project, and express your preference for a mentor that will give you feedback on your progress with the project and connect you to experts when needed. There are no mentor meetings planned this week. When a mentor has accepted this role for your project, you will be informed by the coordinator. You should then reach out to your mentor to confirm when and where you'll be meeting.

### This week lectures 
+ We will hear about the advent of scanning probe methods from **Ingmar Swart** (Monday 13:00 - 15:00).
	+ it will be useful to take a look at the [Nobel lecture of Gerd Binnig](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1986/binnig/lecture/).
+ **Sanli Faez**: On the discovery of superconductivity and Who created the Science factory?
+ On Thursday, September 10th, **Aron Opheij** will teach us how to interface electronic devices using Python 
    + [lecture slides](./Lectures/Slides/lecture_Aron.pptx)
	
### Cohort meeting

During the Monday meeting we will discuss:

## Week 5 (28-09-2020) - Understanding Noise

During this week, you write the necessary code for analysing your measured data and recovering the errors in an efficient way. Try to test your analysis methods on benchmark measurements and identify the sources of noise and error in your experiment.

Make a plan, together with your mentor, for fixing the glitches in the measurement setup, your understanding of your experiment and the physics of it. Execute the plan and explain what you have learned so far to your peers.

During this week, each team will meet with the course coordinators to discuss their progress.
 
### Cohort meeting

#### Before the cohort meeting:

+ Make a first-signal milestone celebration art-piece
+ discuss your revised project goals with your mentor and the course coordinator
+ Identify sources of noise and error in your experiment and write a summary
